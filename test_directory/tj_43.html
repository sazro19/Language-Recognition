<p>A
network that connects Utah's K-12 schools, colleges and universities,
public libraries and healthcare providers is forging ahead with plans
to set up a private LTE network, to address the digital divide. The
<a href="https://uetn.org/">Utah
Education &amp; Telehealth Network (UETN)</a>
began the project to deliver broadband wireless access to facilitate
online learning in the state. The implementation of the first sites
has begun and is expected to be running this fall.</p>
<p>UETN
signed a five-year supply agreement with <a href="http://www.tlcsolutions.us/">TLC
Solutions</a>
to provide the core network infrastructure. <a href="https://quortus.com/">Quortus</a>,
a UK company, will provide the technology, specifically, its Enhanced
Packet Core (EPC) platform.</p>
<p>"TLC
provides us with flexibility in spectrum, radio networks and user
equipment. The EPC [multi-access edge computing] (MEC) solution gives
us exactly what we need to grow a private LTE solution," said
Jim Stewart, UETN chief technology officer, in a press release.
"Their extensive knowledge of LTE and 5G technology is an
essential ingredient in our ability to move forward with this dynamic
and important networking project."</p>

<p>The
project leverages Citizen Band Radio Service (CBRS) spectrum, which
is being promoted by the Federal Communications Commission for
private networks, to support remote learning in areas that are
pricier than or harder to reach with more common forms of broadband,
such as cable, DSL or satellite.</p>
