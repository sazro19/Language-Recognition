<p><img alt="Miami-Dade County Public Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho shows Wi-Fi-on-the-Go on a district-owned school bus." height="495" src="/-/media/EDU/THEJournal/Images/2015/09/20150910_MiamiDade.jpg" style="float: right;" width="330"/>A major Florida school district is piloting a new mobile hot-spot service on its school buses. <a href="http://www.dadeschools.net/" target="_blank">Miami-Dade County Public Schools</a>, which transports almost 60,000 students by bus, has added "WiFi-on-the-Go" in
district-owned buses using a service from <a href="http://www.kajeet.net/" target="_blank">Kajeet</a>.</p>
<p>The new Kajeet SmartBus system includes the Wi-Fi gear, software and data access. The program includes
<a href="https://cradlepoint.com/products/cor-ibr1100-series" target="_blank">Cradlepoint COR IBR1100</a> cellular routers, which are
cloud-managed networking devices specifically for vehicles. That comes with antennas and software for CIPA-compliant filtering, time-of-day
controls, URL allow/deny controls and reporting and analytics.</p>
<p>For data access school systems buy data "in bulk" from Verizon and Sprint and place it into a Kajeet account that's made available for use
in all buses. According to the company, access to the data doesn't expire, and it can be added to any time. </p>

<p>Miami-Dade added the program to extend the school day and allow students extra time to study or research a project while in transit.</p>
<p>"Advanced technology has made Internet connectivity in the classroom fundamental to teaching and learning," said Superintendent of Schools
Alberto Carvalho, in a prepared statement. "But connectivity in non-traditional spaces is becoming increasingly relevant. Our students will
benefit from Wi-Fi on the Go, transforming school buses into vehicles for learning and expanding opportunities to learn before and beyond the
bell."</p>
