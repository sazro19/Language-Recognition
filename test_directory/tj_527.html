<p><a href="http://www.ramsey.k12.nj.us/" target="_blank">Ramsey School District</a> in New Jersey has upgraded to a 100 percent fiber network to support several bandwidth-intensive education initiatives.</p>
<p>The
district has standardized on Google Apps for Education, which requires
a reliable Internet connection for students and teachers to access
online resources. Ramsey SD also deployed more than 2,000 iPads
recently and offers a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) program, two
initiatives that require robust Wi-Fi access. And the Online <a href="http://www.parcconline.org/" target="_blank">PARCC</a> assessments require a strong, reliable Internet connection.</p>
<p>Ramsey School District has been a customer of <a href="https://golightpath.com/" target="_blank">Lightpath</a> Ethernet-based communication services for 15 years, and decided to
stick with  the same service provider for this upgrade. The
district implemented Lightpath's managed Private Fiber Service, with 10
gigabit-per-second (Gbps) connections between several key locations,
including the middle and high school, and 1 Gbps connections to each of
the district's three elementary schools.</p>

<p>The network upgrade
doubles the district's Internet bandwidth and increases connection
speeds between key locations by 10 times, according to a news release.
Lightpath is part of the <a href="http://www.mresc.k12.nj.us/pages/Middlesex_Regional" target="_blank">New Jersey Middlesex Regional Education Services Commission</a> (MRESC) purchasing cooperative, which aims to coordinate cost-efficient
purchasing opportunities for educational institutions. Ramsey School
District took advantage of this opportunity to save money on the
network upgrade.</p>
<p>Ryan Kenny, director of Ramsey School District's
technology department, said he anticipates that the private fiber network will
serve the district's increasing bandwidth needs in the years to come.
"While a 1G Internet connection serves our needs today, we'll likely
have to double or triple that in just the next couple of years," he
said in a prepared statement.</p>
