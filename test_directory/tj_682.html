<p class="deck" id="ph_pcontent3_3_Deck">When the FBI hauled away files related to Los Angeles Unified's massive purchase of iPads and curriculum, it highlighted potential failures in the procurement practices districts have abided by for decades. Are there any lessons there for the rest of us?</p>

<p>While the <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2014/12/03/ipad-deployments-to-continue-at-los-angeles-district-in-time-for-testing.aspx" target="_blank">1-to-1 maelstrom</a> continues buffeting the <a href="http://home.lausd.net/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Unified School District</a>, whose technology procurement practices are under investigation by the <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2014/12/02/fbi-steps-into-l.a.-unified-ipad-fiasco.aspx" target="_blank">FBI as part of a federal grand jury probe</a>, school leaders in other districts may be wondering whether they're on the right side of the law when it comes to their own activities. Some might worry, in particular, as they head off to education technology events, that one-on-one meetings with vendors could one day lead to accusations of undue influence over the purchasing processes for their schools' computing devices.</p>
<p>Policies and regulations related to procurement can actually hinder the education technology buying process, according to <a href="http://www.curriculumassociates.com/lp/smart-series-guide-edtech-procurement.aspx?source=EDTECHPURCHASE" target="_blank">a report issued by a consortium of organizations</a> in 2014. For example, rules related to limiting communications between the vendor and the buyer make sense in the context of "playing fair" for all participants. However, that also prevents districts from taking advantage of outside expertise that could "help inform the buyers of new approaches and methods." At the same time it's also possible to view such offers of expertise as a furtive effort to mold purchasing criteria to benefit a single vendor.</p>

<p>Daniel Owens, a co-author of that report,  spoke to <em>THE Journal</em> about the problems of applying traditional procurement techniques to technology. Owens is a partner in <a href="http://learningaccelerator.org/" target="_blank">The Learning Accelerator</a>, a nonprofit that works to speed up implementation of "high quality blended learning in school districts" across the country.</p>
<p><strong>Applying Standard Procurement Practices Doesn't Work<br/>
</strong>There are multiple challenges to device procurement. For one, a computer is more complex to buy than standard school items such as desks and tables "and things that really don't change that frequently," Owens pointed out. "While you might have three different vendors for pencils, most are the same." But that can't be said for devices, he added, which may have the same manufacturer and overall model but innumerable options for configuration of processors, RAM and visual display, making each device "a completely different computer."</p>
<p>On top of that, the market evolves quickly, he said. "Computers now compared to computers from two years ago and computers two years from now are very, very different."</p>
<p>Plus, pricing itself can change from month to month, even as the typical procurement process  —  with competitive bidding, an open question and answer period and issuance of a request for proposal  —  can take months or even as long as a year.</p>
<p>"By the time everything is purchased and actually reaches the classroom, it could be yesterday's model, when the contract was agreed on the current day's pricing." The result: "You end up paying for a higher cost device that is not as good as the current offering."</p>
<p><strong>Future State: A 'Due Diligence' Portal<br/>
</strong>After years of working with schools, districts and states, The Learning Accelerator sees a need to simplify the coordination of device buying information. Currently, Owens noted, districts recreate the wheel every time they go out shopping for new devices: performing due diligence on manufacturers, vetting specific devices, checking references, hunting down prices and so on.</p>
<p>Owens' organization has created a prototype of a portal where all of that type of information can be shared. "Instead of everybody making all of these individual calls all across the country that are point to point, the information is shared centrally," he explained  —  akin to the kind of information travel sites like Kayak and Expedia make available to their users.</p>
