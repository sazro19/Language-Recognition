<p><a href="https://business.twc.com" target="_blank">Time Warner Cable Business Class</a> (TWCBC) has partnered with <a href="http://www.isafeventures.com" target="_blank">i-SAFE
Ventures</a> with the goal of making it easier for E-Rate schools to comply
with the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act" target="_blank">Children's
Internet Protection Act</a> (CIPA).</p>
<p>The government's <a href="http://www.usac.org/sl/" target="_blank">E-rate</a> program helps
schools pay for Internet access, and participating schools are required to
comply with CIPA laws by educating all of their students about appropriate
online behavior, social networking and cyber bullying, and by communicating and
maintaining an annual Internet Safety Policy document. Maintaining
CIPA-compliance can present a challenge for some schools, and TWCBC hopes to
reduce that burden for its customers through this new partnership.</p>
<p>i-SAFE Ventures offers services intended to make it easier for schools to
comply with the Children's Internet Protection Act and educate students
about online safety. Through this partnership, schools that receive E-Rate
funds for Dedicated Internet Access from TWCBC will be eligible to subscribe to
i-SAFE services at a discounted rate. According to a news release from TWCBC,
"i-SAFE services are easy to use, built to the high standards of child privacy
laws and current educational standards, and more cost and time-efficient than
typical district processes."</p>
