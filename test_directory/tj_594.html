<p><a href="http://www.iisp.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/2016_georgiatech_cyberthreatsreport_onlinescroll.pdf" target="_blank">An annual report</a> published by the <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> examined the emerging cyber threats for the coming year, among them: ever-shrinking personal privacy, lackadaisical security considerations in the Internet of Things and a dearth of trained experts to stay on top of cybersecurity considerations for organizations.</p>
<p>The institute has two academic groups focused on cybersecurity  —  the <a href="http://www.iisp.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Institute for Information Security &amp; Privacy (IISP)</a>; and the <a href="http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI)</a>, a university-affiliated research center for the United States Department of Defense  —  and designation by the <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/index.shtml" target="_blank">National Security Agency</a> as a <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/ia/academic_outreach/nat_cae/" target="_blank">National Security Agency Center of Excellence in Information Assurance</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, almost two dozen cybersecurity experts from the institute, business, government and defense gathered to share their observations about emerging trends in a more connected world. At the same time, the school issued its report on emerging cyber threats for 2016.</p>
<p>In the age of the smartphone, personal privacy is becoming ever less possible. Even as big business focuses on the collection of big data to improve their marketing and other operations, consumers face a growing privacy risk. Their use of mobile devices may offer them convenience, but it also allows organizations to track their habits and movement. Advanced pattern-matching capabilities allow companies to compile remarkably detailed profiles "on even the most private citizens," the report noted. And reversing the trend "will be nearly impossible."</p>
<p>Too often, the report stated, "a person is faced with a choice of agreeing to the slightly distasteful collection of their data or to being completely unable to sign up for a useful service, an entertaining game or connecting with friends through social media." It's an all-or-nothing proposition.</p>
<p>Privacy policies as an antidote "have largely failed." They're not flexible or consumer-minded. Georgia Tech researcher Amy Bruckman and former student Casey Fiesler found that most of us don't read online policies and even if we did for the services and apps we use, it would take us an average of "over 200 hours per year."</p>
<p>Our growing preference for mobile devices over desktop devices means we have become walking, trackable "intellectual property assets" for a wide range of organizations, added Peter Swire, professor of law and ethics in <a href="http://www.scheller.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Tech's College of Business</a>.</p>
<p>The monitoring doesn't stop there. It's matched with a growth in video and signals monitoring within public spaces, paired with data taken from license plates, facial images and smartphone IDs. "Real-world monitoring will increasingly resemble online tracking," the report noted.</p>
<p>The Internet of Things is expected to compound the problem of security and trust, the report asserted. The same is true for other "cyber-physical" interfaces, such as industrial control systems.</p>
<p>As devices enter every realm of industry and consumer life, "security needs to become a higher priority," said A.P. Meliopoulos, a Georgia Tech professor of electrical and computer engineering. "We are seeing the same thing with other physical systems. Transportation, health systems, robotics  —  everything is converted into the cyber-domain, and that increases the number of entry points for attack."</p>
