<p>The <a href="http://www.pwcgov.org/government/bocs/pages/bocs-landing-page.aspx" target="_blank">Prince William Board of County Supervisors</a> has authorized a $100,000 performance agreement with <a href="http://scriyb.com">Scriyb</a>, a technology startup company based at the <a href="http://vsgi.gmu.edu" target="_blank">Virginia Serious Games Institute</a>, to pioneer a new cloud-based live-streaming teaching platform for online education.</p>
<p>This agreement allows Scriyb to scale up and deliver on its mission of engaging STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) K–12 students, who will potentially be a future generation of workers able to address high skill shortage needs regionally and nationally.</p>
<p>“By reshaping access to education, we are unlocking the potential to continue to deliver a highly skilled workforce and fundamentally shift the new economic paradigm,” said Corey A. Stewart, chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, in a statement. “We hope this marks just the beginning of the potential for Scriyb and the advancement in STEM learning.”</p>

<p>The Prince William Board of County Supervisors authorized an agreement between Scriyb and the Industrial Development Authority (IDA) of Prince William County and assigned a $100,000 grant from the <a href="http://www.pwcecondev.org/incentives" target="_blank">Prince William County Economic Development Opportunity Fund</a> (EDOF). The conditions of the grant require Scriyb to receive matching funds from the <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/node/736583" target="_blank">Commonwealth of Virginia’s Center for Innovative Technology GAP Funds</a>, maintain five full-time staff positions, and relocate to commercial space in the county along with 13 full-time hires and $25,000 in equipment by the end of December 2017.</p>
<p>According to Scriyb, its cloud-based online education platform bridges the gap for increased demand for specialized STEM instruction of K–12 students, allowing a single teacher to effectively instruct thousands of students in real-time, via a live streaming tool, without sacrificing quality of instruction. Scriyb’s patent-pending algorithms segment an instruction course’s body of students into smaller groups, creating peer-to-peer learning and teacher-student matching, while virtually tracking, measuring, analyzing and correctly balancing the social learning environment.</p>
<p>Scriyb’s online platform will be used to deliver the project lessons to the students of two participating Prince William County public high schools — Forest Park and Potomac. The dual enrollment program will begin in spring 2017 and potentially benefit 200 students. </p>
