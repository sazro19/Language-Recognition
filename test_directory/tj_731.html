<p>When the <a href="http://www.setda.org/" target="_blank">State Educational Technology Directors Association</a> (SETDA) released "<a href="http://www.setda.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/The_Broadband_Imperative.pdf" target="_blank">The Broadband Imperative</a>" in 2012, the most attention-grabbing part of the 37-page report was a small box containing four numbers: minimum bandwidth targets for both external and internal connections. The report stated that by the 2014–2015 school year — this year — districts should have an external Internet connection to the service provider of at least 100 megabits per second for every thousand users. The target for the internal wide area network that connects the district offices and schools was at least a gigabit. The goals for the 2017–2018 school year were an order of magnitude higher.</p>
<p>According to Christine Fox, SETDA's director of educational leadership and research, to come up with those recommendations, a working group decided that capacity should support a 1-to-1 program where "students and teachers really wanted to work seamlessly without worrying about planning a lesson [and wondering] if everyone was going to have enough access to participate in a particular activity." SETDA's broadband numbers have since been adopted, endorsed and cited as a viable standard by districts, states and education organizations such as the <a href="http://www.cosn.org/" target="_blank">Consortium for School Networking (CoSN)</a>, the federal <a href="http://www.ed.gov/" target="_blank">Department of Education</a> and even the White House.</p>

<p>To see whether SETDA's four famous numbers have become a reality in schools around the country, we asked district leaders how they have built capacity to meet their broadband needs both now and in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Reality Meets Recommendations<br/>
</strong><a href="https://www.dysart.org/MainSite/" target="_blank"><strong>Dysart Unified School District</strong></a> (AZ) recently completed a long-term project to make all of the schools in the entire 140-square-mile system capable of sustaining wireless inside and out. According to CIO John Andrews, that process began in 2010 when the district was able to apply E-rate funds to infrastructure upgrades at five schools. He has used bandwidth guidance from SETDA as a jumping off point in E-rate applications to help determine how much to request and "how much is enough."</p>
<p>The external connection at Dysart has grown from 400 Mbps to 4 Gbps over the years and is on track to be 10 Gbps in its next expansion. Only when that next iteration is in place will the district, with 26,000 students, actually meet the current SETDA target.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the WAN doesn't come close. With an average school size of 1,130 students, SETDA would recommend at least 1 Gbps for each school. And that's the goal that Dysart's IT department has set: to upgrade every single internal connection to a gig. But right now, the reality is that some schools within Dysart have 400 Mbps connections; others have 100 Mbps.</p>
<p>Is that sufficient? Andrews has found that every network-related improvement results in increased technology use in the classrooms. And despite  the gap between the recommendations and real life, the network is just dandy. In fact, a recent "<a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2015/01/29/to-prepare-for-online-assesments-some-schools-try-to-break-their-own-networks.aspx" target="_blank">stress test</a>," in which users attempted to bring the network down by simultaneously streaming video from <a href="http://www.teachertube.com/" target="_blank">TeacherTube</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3yA8nDwraeOfnYfBWun83g" target="_blank">YouTube for Education</a>, showed that, as Andrews reported, schools with internal connections of at least 400 Mbps experienced "zero issues with connectivity," and schools with 100 Mbps had "some slowness once they surpassed the 400 devices online."</p>
