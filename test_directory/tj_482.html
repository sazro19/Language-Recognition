<p>In 2013, President Obama  launched the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/k-12/connected" target="_blank">ConnectED </a> initiative with the goal of  connecting 99 percent of K-12 students in America with access to broadband  Internet in the classroom by the year 2018. Since ConnectED was launched, 20  million more students have gained access to broadband at school, according to  Joseph South, director of the <a href="http://tech.ed.gov/" target="_blank">Office of Educational  Technology </a> of the United States Department of Education. At the same  time, more and more schools have implemented laptops, tablets and online  educational resources. While initiatives such as ConnectED are helping to close  the digital divide in the classroom, that divide reopens once the school day is  over. </p>
<p>
As of 2014, nearly one quarter  of American households still did not have Internet access, according to a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160308_broadband_cea_issue_brief.pdf" target="_blank">March 2016 Issue Brief </a> from the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/cea" target="_blank">Council of Economic Advisers </a>. Low-income  households are far less likely to have Internet, "with just under half of  households in the bottom income quintile using the Internet at home, compared  to 95 percent of households in the top quintile," according to the report. </p>

This disparity in home Internet  service has lead to the "homework gap," where economically  disadvantaged students "go from a digital oasis to a digital desert when  they go from school to home," as Chike Aguh, CEO of <a href="http://everyoneon.org/" target="_blank">EveryoneOn </a> described it. Some of these  students are going to extraordinary lengths to complete their assignments,  standing outside their schools at night trying to pick up WiFi signals through  the wall, or going to the public library or local businesses to do their  homework. </p>
<p>
"I applaud those students,  but that is not an acceptable solution, and it's tremendously inequitable in  providing them an education that's similar to their peers," South said. </p>
<p>
<strong>Reasons for the Homework Gap <br/>
</strong>Some people have attributed the  homework gap to the lack of Internet infrastructure in rural and remote areas.  However, the majority of families that are not connected to the Internet live  in urban areas that do have infrastructure. They simply can't afford it. </p>
<p>
"There are 64 million  Americans who are not connected to the Internet. Only 16 million of those are  offline because there's not infrastructure," Aguh said. "The other 48 million  are living in big urban metro areas where they have offers available to them.  It's just that they cannot afford them. So we need to change our thinking and  our mindset and our stereotype that this is a rural problem. It's not. It is  really an urban and suburban problem." </p>
<p>
But the homework gap can exist  even in households that do have Internet service, according to Sarah  Trimble-Oliver, the chief information officer for <a href="http://www.cps-k12.org/" target="_blank">Cincinnati Public Schools </a>. A couple of years  ago, that district surveyed its students to ask if they had Internet at home,  and 75 percent of students answered yes. However, Trimble-Oliver soon  discovered that they hadn't asked the right question. </p>
<p>
"What we're finding is  that, even though they answered yes, there was a large percentage who only have  access through a smartphone," she said. "Or they have access but it's too slow.  Or they have a computer in the home, but it's shared amongst five or six family  members, so actually getting time on that Internet-enabled computer is  difficult in order to complete homework. And then we have families who may have  Internet access one month but then the next month it's interrupted because  either the bill wasn't paid, or the data plan on their phone ran out. It's not  a simple yes or no question." </p>
