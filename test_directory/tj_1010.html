<p class="deck" id="ph_pcontent3_3_Deck">Four K-12 technology leaders explain how they're changing the way they work with educators to meet the new demands of 21st century schools. They also offer up some of their trade secrets for building consensus, overcoming poor morale and generally keeping the peace between IT and academic staff.</p>

<p>Years ago, typical K-12 IT leaders came up through the administrative ranks and focused on keeping computers and business applications running. Whether they were called CTOs or CIOs, they had compartmentalized skill sets that tended to favor technology over teaching. In 2014, however, the role of chief information officer or chief technology officer is just as likely to go to a former teacher or principal with an interest in finding new ways to harness technology to collaborate with curriculum and assessment leaders. </p>
<p> Indeed, when the <a href="http://www.cosn.org/" target="_blank">Consortium for School Networking</a> (CoSN) surveyed 250 IT leaders in 2013 about their key concerns, 65.7 percent of respondents cited the change to a student-focused BYOD environment, while 39.8 percent mentioned the need to break down silos in their districts. CoSN noted that these results "show that IT leadership is clearly focused on the education and learning environment in a district, rather than the business environment, despite their budgetary challenges."</p>
<p> What separates CTOs who play a significant role in teaching and learning from those who don't? THE Journal asked four school district technology leaders about how their job responsibilities are changing and how they have broken down barriers between curriculum and technology departments to create a culture of innovation in the classroom.</p>

<p><strong>Remove Roadblocks<br/>
</strong>Tom Murray said that one of the biggest problems school districts face is a disconnect between curriculum and technology departments. "We want ours to work in lockstep," said Murray, director of technology and cyber education for the <a href="http://www.qcsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1" target="_blank">Quakertown Community School District</a> in Bucks County, PA, which has 10 schools and approximately 5,500 students. One way he has addressed the problem was to embed an employee, Chad Evans, in the curriculum department. "His title is 21st century learning facilitator, and his role is to bridge the gap between curriculum and technology," Murray explained.</p>
<p> Murray started his career as a classroom teacher and was a principal for five years before moving to the technology department three years ago. "In my experience, many directors of technology understand a lot about networking and infrastructure but don't understand how technology impacts what takes place in the classroom," he said. "It is important for the technology executives to spend time in the classroom, especially if they don't come from a teaching background." </p>
<p>He said they shouldn't make decisions from a district office without understanding the true impact those choices can have in a kindergarten class.</p>
<p> Murray said his job is made easier because his superintendent, Lisa Andrejko, is tech-savvy herself. "She has a vision for 21st century education and pulled me from a principal's job to be director of technology and cyber education to help establish that," he said. "I liked it because I can take advantage of my passion for technology — but technology in the hands of students to make a difference in their education."</p>
<p> Murray said he's comfortable wearing two hats at once. "On the infrastructure side of things," he said, "I rely on the strong team we have to make sure we are a great customer service organization." </p>
<p>But he also challenges the traditional technology department "lock it and block it" mentality. "That is outdated, I believe. One of our goals is to remove roadblocks and to stop saying, 'You're not allowed to do that.' With students, we focus not on acceptable use policies but on responsible use. We want to teach digital citizenship. We are not going to set policy for the 2 percent who are knuckleheads. We are setting them for the 98 percent and then deal with any scenarios as they arise."</p>
<p> At the same time, Murray stays involved in teaching through Quakertown's "cyber school" initiative. "Our students can schedule any combination of face-to-face and cyber classes that meets their needs," he said. All the courses are designed from the ground up, taught by Quakertown faculty and analyzed by the director of curriculum. According to Murray, since the initiative launched, "We have seen a 10 percent increase in graduation rates and the highest student achievement levels ever."</p>
