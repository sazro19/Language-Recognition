<p><a href="http://www.worthington.k12.oh.us/" target="_blank">Worthington School District</a>
in Ohio has implemented a fiber network to connect all 21 district sites.</p>
<p>The district upgraded its network in preparation for the
<a href="http://www.parcconline.org/" target="_blank">Partnership for Assessment of Readiness
for College and Careers</a> (PARCC) assessments, which are online math and
English language arts assessments in line with the
<a href="http://www.corestandards.org/" target="_blank">Common Core State Standards</a> (CCSS).
When the district made the decision to upgrade its network for online
assessments, it also wanted to ensure the technology could scale with future
growth. </p>
<p>The district partnered with <a href="http://www.fibertech.com/" target="_blank">Fibertech
Networks</a> to build a scalable network consisting of 10 gigabit point-to-point
circuits for 18 district sites and feeding into a 100 gigabit ring that connects
the district's three hub sites. According to Fibertech, the company used
<a href="http://www.ciena.com/" target="_blank">Ciena's</a> converged packet optical and packet
networking solutions to build direct fiber optic connectivity into each site
through its existing 350-mile network in Columbus.</p>

<p>Since implementing the fiber optic network, students and teachers no longer
have to contend with connection or latency issues when using online video and
communications such as Skype or Adobe Connect, and students can now make full
use of Web-based instructional software.</p>
<p>"The network also allows us to provide virtual desktop infrastructure for
district users, centralizing support and maintenance of desktop applications,"
said Keith Schlarb, director of information technology at Worthington SD, in a
prepared statement. "We are confident that whatever online instruction or
technology tools the district decides to implement in the future the bandwidth
is available. We have no real restrictions on our bandwidth and that will mean
better prepared students for life after high school."</p>
