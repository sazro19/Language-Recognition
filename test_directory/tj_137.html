<p>At the <a href="https://nasro.org/conference/" target="_blank">National  Association of School Resource Officers</a> <a href="https://nasro.org/conference/" target="_blank">annual conference</a>, a thousand-plus  attendees made up primarily of school-based law enforcement officers, school  administrators and school security and safety professionals hit the tradeshow  aisles to see the latest in <a href="https://nightlock.com/lockdown-door-barricade-devices/" target="_blank">classroom door  lockdown technology</a>, <a href="https://wolfcomusa.com/" target="_blank">body cameras</a> and <a href="https://www.hytera.us/case-studies/education" target="_blank">radio systems</a>. While  we don't all need <a href="https://premierbodyarmor.com/" target="_blank">knapsack armor panels</a>,  here are six technologies that may find a home on your campus, several of which  are free for educators.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alertus.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Alertus Technologies</strong></a>, which works with schools to integrate  their existing emergency mass notification systems into a  "one-button" operation, talked up free availability of its "<a href="https://www.alertus.com/donation" target="_blank">Alertus Desktop Donation Initiative</a>."  Under this program schools  —  both K-12 and post-secondary  —  gain an  enterprise-wide perpetual license of the company's <a href="https://www.alertus.com/alertusproducts/desktop" target="_blank">desktop notification  system</a>. The purpose, according to Miles Harriger, who runs higher education  sales, is to give schools a free way to communicate in an emergency.</p>

<p>The desktop system can take over the full-screen, run in  "ticker mode" at the top of the screen, deliver audible alerts and  provide pop-up or quarter-screen mode. The donation includes the core Alertus server  software, an activation console program and unlimited use of the desktop  notification client software, which runs on both PCs and Macs. K-12 schools  that have taken advantage of the program include <a href="http://www.pusd10.org/" target="_blank">Payson Unified School District</a> in Arizona and <a href="http://www.burke.k12.nc.us/" target="_blank">Burke County Public Schools</a> in North  Carolina.</p>
<p><a href="https://identakid.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Ident-A-Kid</strong></a> showed off its latest version of software for  visitor management. The application is intended to automate the process of  approving daily entry of staff, students, volunteers and other visitors.  They're pre-entered into the system, which checks their ID against a sexual  offender list and a school-created "banned persons list," before granting  them access to the campus. According to Emily Fellouzis, director of  development and sales, most schools run the program as a stand-alone kiosk; the  remainder have an attendant stationed at the front door to grant access after  performing an ID check. When somebody should be denied entry, a notification is  sent via email, text message and desktop alert.</p>
<p>The latest version, released in January 2018, was converted  to a modern web-based interface. "Schools don't always have the best  internet," she said. Now they can run "the entire system offline or,  if they need to, on a mobile device with an administrator moving around the  school. Everything is reportable from the cloud."</p>
<p>She said the new release also added face detection, touch-screen  compatibility and an enhanced "no-go" feature that allows for the  school to upload pictures and documents (such as court orders) to help the  person reviewing the alert "make a more informed decision."</p>
<p><a href="https://fatalvision.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Innocorp</strong></a> demonstrated its newest addition to the Fatal Vision simulation  goggles line. <a href="https://fatalvision.com/simulation-goggles/drowsy-distracted-goggles.html" target="_blank">FatalVision  Drowsy and Distracted Goggles</a> flashes from a clear view to a black view for  4.6 seconds at a time to give wearers the experience of drowsy or distracted  driving. According to President and CEO, Michael Aguilar, that duration has  been proven in research to be the average amount of time a person takes his or  her eyes off the road to check a text.</p>
