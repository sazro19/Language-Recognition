<p>Houghton Mifflin Harcourt has introduced a new collection of grade-specific tablet apps for kindergarten through sixth grade. The Common Core Reading Practice and Assessment apps are available for $1.99 in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hmh-common-core-reading-practice/id647280166?mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a> and on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hmhpub.MobileAssessment.GoReading.G3" target="_blank">Google Play</a>. Designed for today’s increasingly mobile students, teachers and families, the apps provide literacy exercises and practice tests aligned to the ELA Common Core State Standards.</p>
<p>The Common Core Reading Practice and Assessment apps can be used independently or as a supplement to an existing reading program. Weekly practice and assessment reading passages integrate science and social studies topics. Texts are aligned to appropriate Lexile levels and increase in complexity to support literacy growth. Exercises are designed to reinforce key skills such as phonics, reading comprehension and vocabulary acquisition, while corrective feedback strengthens test-taking strategies.</p>

<p>The apps provide practice for PARCC and Smarter Balanced's assessments by using tech-enhanced items that ask students to “drag and drop” or “tap to choose." The apps' Teacher Resource Center offers real-time reports on student performance, including number of attempts and right or wrong answers.</p>
