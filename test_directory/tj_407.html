<p>Next year's wireless headphones, fitness trackers, glucose  monitors and in-car audio traffic navigators are expected to offer a longer  range, faster performance and a larger broadcast message capacity with this  week's adoption of <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/bluetooth-core-specification/bluetooth5" target="_blank">Bluetooth  5</a>. Bluetooth is a low-power, short-range wireless standard that shows up in  consumer electronics, home automation, medical devices, automotive and a lot of  other product categories. It's the technology that enabled Apple to eliminate  its headphone jack from the latest iPhone models; the company's coming AirPods ear  buds rely on Bluetooth to connect to the device.</p>
<p>The new specification, officially approved by the <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/" target="_blank">Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG)</a>, delivers  four times the range, double the speed and eight times the broadcast message  capacity of the previous standard, Bluetooth 4.x. Version 5 is expected to  provide coverage across a house-sized building and deliver more responsive  performance (2 megabits per second compared to 4.x's one Mbps). In addition, Bluetooth  5 adds functionality to address interference with other wireless technologies.</p>

<p>According to Mark Powell, executive director of the  Bluetooth SIG, the overall spec will enable "whole-home and building  coverage, as well as new use cases for outdoor, industrial, and commercial  applications." The SIG is made up of companies that use Bluetooth in their  products.</p>
<p>Powell also expects the new specification to  "revolutionize" implementation of the Internet of Things. According to <a href="https://www.abiresearch.com/press/bluetooth-smart-evolution-helps-technology-break-k/" target="_blank">ABI  Research projections</a>, Bluetooth will surface in more than 5 billion "smart"  and "smart ready" devices by 2021. A particular area of growth will  be Bluetooth beacons, which surface in personal tracking tags, retail and  advertising. In a <a href="https://www.abiresearch.com/market-research/product/1023885-market-data-for-bluetooth/" target="_blank">market  data report</a>, ABI said it expected Bluetooth beacons in those markets to see  annual growth of 133 percent between 2016 and 2021.</p>
<p>As industry analyst Andrew Zignani noted, "Increased  broadcast messaging capacity in Bluetooth 5 will help drive these markets, as  beacons will be able to provide much higher quality content and richer  contextual information than ever before."</p>
<p>Powell said that consumers could expect to see products  built with Bluetooth 5 within two to six months of the release of the new  specification.</p>
