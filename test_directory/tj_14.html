<p>Despite electronic component shortages caused by the public policy
response to the pandemic, traditional PCs (notebooks, desktops and
workstations) saw 13.2% year-over-year growth in the second quarter
of 2021. However, largely owing to shortages, desktops grew at a
higher rate than notebooks, according to a <a href="https://www.idc.com/tracker/showproductinfo.jsp?containerId=IDC_P36344" target="_blank">preliminary
report</a> from market research firm IDC. 
</p>
<p>
The growth in the second quarter was, however, much less substantial
than the previous two quarters (55.9% in the first quarter of the
year and 25.8% in the fourth quarter of last year). 
</p>
<p>
"The market faces mixed signals as far as demand is concerned,"
said Neha Mahajan, senior research analyst with IDC’s Devices and
Displays Group, in a prepared statement. "With businesses
opening back up, demand potential in the commercial segment appears
promising. However, there are also early indicators of consumer
demand slowing down as people shift spending priorities after nearly
a year of aggressive PC buying."</p>
