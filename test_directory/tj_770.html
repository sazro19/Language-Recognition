<p>Apple is making something of a comeback in the smart phone market. While Google's Android OS continues to be — by far — the most widespread handset operating system overall, among individual vendors, Apple has pushed itself into a dead heat with No. 1 manufacturer Samsung.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter, Apple's iPhone shipments soared 46 percent compared with the same period the previous year, totaling 74.5 million units and capturing 19.85 percent of the smart phone market worldwide, according to market research firm <a href="http://www.idc.com/" target="_blank">International Data Corp. (IDC)</a>.</p>
<p>Samsung, still in the lead for the quarter and the full year, shipped 75.1 million units, off 11 percent from last year, to capture 20.01 percent of the market (8.82 points lower than in the same period last year).</p>
<p>"Most of the industry expected an extremely strong holiday quarter from Apple, especially with regards to the iPhone. However, worldwide shipments of 74.5 million units beat everyone's expectations," said Ryan Reith, program director with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, in a prepared statement. "Beyond the record-setting quarter, a few impressive things stand out with regard to Apple. First, at a time when average selling prices (ASPs) for smartphone are rapidly declining, Apple managed to increase its reported ASPs in the fourth quarter due to higher-cost new models. Second, the growth of iPhone sales in both the U.S., which is considered a saturated market, and China, which presents the dual challenges of strong local competitors and serious price sensitivity, were remarkable. Sustaining this growth and higher ASPs a year from now could prove challenging, but right now there is no question that Apple is leading the way."</p>

<p>According to IDC, for the quarter overall, smart phone shipments were up 28.2 percent compared with the previous year, reaching 375.2 million units.</p>
<p>"Apple reached a new quarterly shipment record in 4Q14 and fell just short of surpassing Samsung for overall leadership in the smartphone market. An elevated consumer appetite for big-screen devices, as well as Apple's push into China and other countries, saw iPhone sales up 44 percent in the U.S. and up 97 percent in the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China)," according to IDC. "Sales doubled year-over-year in China, Brazil, and Singapore. What remains to be seen is how long Apple can sustain this runaway growth."</p>
<p>Top-5 vendors Lenovo, Huawei and Xiaomi all saw positive growth. Lenovo grew 77.9 percent year over year, shipping 24.7 million units and capturing 6.59 percent of the overall market. Huawei grew 41.7 percent to 23.5 million units, with a 6.25 percent market share. And Xiaomi grew 178.6 percent to 16.6 million units, capturing 4.42 percent of the market.</p>
<p>Shipments from all other manufacturers combined grew 33.1 percent in the quarter to 160.9 million units.</p>
