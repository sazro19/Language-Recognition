<p><a href="https://www.oculus.com/rift/" target="_blank">Oculus Rift</a> is out, but <a href="https://www.oculus.com" target="_blank">Oculus</a> is in. Even as <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>'s virtual reality system had just 99,000 shipments during the first quarter of 2017, the Oculus deal with Samsung drove the latter company's shipments to five times as many units over the same period. <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-vr/" target="_blank">Samsung's Gear VR</a> runs software co-developed with Oculus.

<p>The total number of shipments across all vendors reached 2.3 million units in Q1 2017, a rise of 77 percent compared to the same quarter in 2016. And the research company said it expects the full year to experience triple-digit growth, with the onset of a new slate of products expected to ship during the second half of 2017. (For its tracker, IDC omits headsets without technology built in, such as Google Cardboard.)</p>

<p>So-called "screenless" viewers dominate, with two-thirds of all headset shipments. Devices such as the Samsung Gear VR and <a href="https://madeby.google.com/vr/" target="_blank">Google's Daydream View</a> do have screens, but they're provided by the smartphones that are inserted into the headset to run the VR apps. Screenless is the term adopted by the industry to describe headsets that don't have to be "tethered" to the high-end computing device. The tethered headsets, including the <a href="https://www.vive.com/us/" target="_blank">HTC Vive</a>, Oculus Rift, and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-vr/" target="_blank">Sony's PlayStation VR</a>, make up the remaining third of the market.</p>
