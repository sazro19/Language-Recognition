<p>Smartphone sales will continue to grow through 2021 to reach 1.7  billion shipments that year, according to a new forecast from <a href="https://www.idc.com/" target="_blank">International Data Corp.</a> (IDC).</p>
<p>Up from 1.47 billion in 2016, that forecast would represent a compound  annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.3 percent over five years.</p>
<p>"The big inflection point that everyone is watching for is when the  smartphone market experiences its first year-over-year decline," said Ryan  Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device  Trackers, in a prepared statement. "We believe the two main catalysts for  continued growth are bringing first-time users onto a smartphone and  maintaining life cycles that are close to two years. At the end of 2016, we  estimated that about half of the world's population was using a smartphone,  which leaves plenty of room for additional first-time users. And, despite very  high saturation levels in mature markets like North America, Western Europe,  Korea, and Japan, we still see the majority of users replacing their handsets  roughly every two years. We expect these trends will hold through the forecast."</p>

<p>Shipments of Android devices will reach 1.276 billion this year for a market  share of about 82 percent and 2.3 percent growth compared to last year. The forecast  calls for Android shipments to reach 1.479 billion in 2021 for a market share  of 85.5 percent and a CAGR of 3.5 percent from 2016-2021.</p>
<p>"The Android OS continues to dominate on a global level, and IDC  expects shipments on the platform to slightly outperform the market with 2.3  percent year-over-year growth in 2017," according to a news release. "In  terms of volume, Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) continues to lead the way  consuming nearly 55 percent of shipments throughout the forecast period. Growth  at the high end from brands such as <a href="http://www.oppo.com/en/index.html" target="_blank">OPPO</a>, <a href="http://www.vivo.com/en/" target="_blank">Vivo</a> and <a href="http://www.huawei.com/us/" target="_blank">Huawei</a> have also led to a 17 percent  increase in average selling price (ASP) within the region, showing that the  high end has more room to grow. Android ASPs have also risen in other big  markets like Latin America, the United States and Western Europe. With many  brands opting to push premium phablet offerings to combat the likes of the  larger iPhone, devices with screen sizes larger than 5.5 inches should grow  34.5 percent year over year in 2017 with ASPs growing 9.2 percent as a result."</p>
