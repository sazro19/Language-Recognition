<p>The <a href="http://cosn.org/" target="_blank">Consortium for School Networking</a> (CoSN) Thursday released an updated version of its national privacy toolkit for school system leaders. </p>
<p>The new “<a href="http://cosn.org/focus-areas/leadership-vision/protecting-privacy" target="_blank">Protecting Privacy in Connected Learning, Version 3</a>” toolkit serves as an "in-depth guide to key student data privacy laws” and how these laws operate together, according to the CoSN site. The updated version offers more information on the <a href="https://ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html" target="_blank">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act</a> (FERPA), the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule" target="_blank">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act</a> (COPPA) and the <a href="http://familypolicy.ed.gov/ppra" target="_blank">Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment</a>. In addition, CoSN has expanded definitions of key privacy terms, suggested contract terms and more. New information on metadata and data identification issues, as well as click-wrap agreements, has also been added.</p>

<p>The toolkit gives advice to school leaders, ranging from personnel changes to best practices for information parents and families. One resource, “<a href="http://cosn.org/sites/default/files/CoSN_10Steps.pdf" target="_blank">10 Steps Every District Should Take Today</a>,” for example, suggests that districts designate a senior administrator who will be responsible for ensuring accountability for privacy laws and policies. </p>
