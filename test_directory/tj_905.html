<p><a href="https://windmillschool.taw.org.uk/" target="_blank">Windmill Primary School</a> in
Telford, UK, has implemented a 802.11ac wireless network to provide school-wide
connectivity for students and staff. </p>
<p>The number of wireless devices accessing the school's network strained its
previous WiFi infrastructure and couldn't provide full coverage across every
building. Since the school is planning to purchase 360 802.11ac-compatible
laptops for every student in the next academic year as part of its one device
per pupil initiative, it needed to revamp its wireless network to support the
new devices.</p>
<p>The school selected an 802.11ac <a href="http://www.xirrus.com/" target="_blank">Xirrus</a>
wireless network with
<a href="http://www.xirrus.com/Products/Wireless-Arrays/Access-Points/XR-600-(1)" target="_blank">
XR-620</a> access points (APs). The APs feature dual 802.11ac radios, so they
can operate in either the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bands, "depending on the current
client mix," according to the company. The school will also use the Xirrus
Management System (XMS) to manage the wireless network and Xirrus Application
Control to optimize device performance.</p>

<p>The new network provides higher WiFi density and more consistent wireless
coverage across all of its buildings. Students at the school use their iPads and
Lenovo Yogas to access online services, video streaming and learning activities
through YouTube and <a href="http://www.espresso.co.uk/" target="_blank">Espresso</a> online
learning. Classrooms in the school are equipped with Sahara LED screens, and
teachers use <a href="http://www.wepresentwifi.com/index.html" target="_blank">WePresent</a> to
wirelessly control what's shown on the students' screens. The upgraded wireless
network is intended to support the school's growing use of educational
technology.</p>
<p>"The Internet speed and performance all around the school are much better,
which has reduced frustration for teachers and students trying to work, stream
and communicate at once," said Mark Gibbons, head teacher at the school, in a
prepared statement. </p>
<p>Windmill Primary School in Telford, UK, located northeast of Birmingham,
serves 360 students between the ages of 4 and 11.</p>
