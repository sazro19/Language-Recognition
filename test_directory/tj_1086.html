<p>Online Common Core assessments will be required in most schools in the United States in 2015. Many teachers are enjoying facets of the standards, but educators and other stakeholders have raised concerns about the requirement for online assessments.</p>
<p>Below are four of the top concerns people have about online testing — and suggestions for addressing them.</p>
<p><strong>1. Our Network Can't Handle It.</strong><br/>
<a href="http://www.educationsuperhighway.org/%5D" target="_blank">EducationSuperhighway</a>, a nonprofit organization that supports schools in upgrading their networks, estimates that 61  percent of schools in the United States don't meet the 50 Kbps per student threshold recommended by the assessment consortia to ensure that schools can fully implement the Common Core tests.  EducationSuperHighway (along with SEDTA and other organizations) recommend 100 Mbps per thousand students or staff as a baseline for schools adopting digital learning. The non-profit estimates that 72 percent of schools do not currently meet this threshold.</p>
<p>EducationSuperhighway has <a href="http://www.educationnews.org/technology/gates-zuckerberg-give-9-million-for-high-speed-internet-in-schools/" target="_blank">made the news recently</a> because of a $9 million dollar donation from Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. If your network isn't up to par and you are looking for lower-cost ways to upgrade, check their <a href="http://www.educationsuperhighway.org/solutions-for-schools.html" target="_blank">program page</a> for ways to partner with them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meritsoftware.com/index.php">Merit Software's</a> Ben Weintraub said he has seen schools where the network is the problem. Wireless networks, he says, are popular, but they may not be able to handle the traffic necessary for the Common Core assessments. "Sometimes it's as simple as asking the school to put a direct access point in a room" to improve network speeds and reliability. Each school will need to assess their technology needs and see what upgrades they will need to make to hit the speed benchmarks they need to.</p>
<p><strong>2. Our Computers Can't Handle It.</strong><br/>
If schools do not have newer hardware — and enough of it to ensure timely testing — they may not be equipped to offer computer-based high-stakes testing. Weintraub also said he has seen the vast disparity in the number and types of computers in different regions of the country as his company has rolled out and supported their online interactive learning software.</p>
<p>Plenty of schools who have chosen their product are working great, but there are some that Weintraub said he just doesn't see being successful with the Common Core testing unless they make huge investments. One school he discussed has a lab of computers running Windows XP and they complained about lag and slowness with the product. In their <a href="http://www.smarterbalanced.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Tech_Framework_Device_Requirements_11-1-13.pdf" target="_blank">technology requirements document</a>, <a href="http://www.smarterbalanced.org/" target="_blank">Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium</a>, one of the groups developing the tests, suggests that schools upgrade to Windows 7 rather than using Windows XP, mainly because Microsoft is sunsetting support for that OS this year.</p>
<p>"It's going to be a complicated issue," Weintraub said, and "how they are going to get the money" is one of the chief concerns for school districts that have outdated machines and software.</p>
<p><strong>3. Our Teachers Can't Handle It.</strong><br/>
If you're concerned that your teachers will need a lot of professional development to get up to speed on the online testing system, you're probably right. But they may be more motivated to complete that training and begin using the technology tools than you might think.</p>
<p>Washington Post education columnist Jay Mathews — long against the Common Core — <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/im-no-common-core-fan-but-give-it-a-chance/2014/01/04/c8abc41e-6c3e-11e3-aecc-85cb037b7236_story.html" target="_blank">recently said</a> the teachers he has spoken to are excited about the new standards.</p>
