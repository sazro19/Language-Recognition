<p>Usually articles that talk about education technology trends and predictions appear at the end of year (e.g., Schaffhauser and Kelly’s <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/11/02/top-10-education-technologies-that-will-be-dead-and-gone-in-the-next-decade.aspx">predictions</a>) or at the beginning of the year (e.g., Kajeet’s <a href="http://www.kajeet.net/extracurricular/5-ed-tech-predictions-for-2017">predictions</a>). Throwing tradition to the wind, in this week’s blog post, coming during the home stretch of 2016 income tax filing season, we identify four trends that we predict will redefine K–12 education over the next five years. Redefine K–12? Yes! We understand the serious nature of that claim. So, without further ado, let’s see if we can’t convince you of our vision!</p>
<p><strong>Trend 1: Paper-based textbooks are disappearing. </strong></p>
<p>Yes, textbooks are some of the last paper-based books to stick around since, yes, districts are still purchasing paper-based textbooks. (Want a reference? Check with your local school board!) But the paper-based textbook industry is <a href="http://newsroom.publishers.org/publishers-sales-down-at-the-start-of-2016-ebooks-decline">not growing</a>; just the opposite. Textbook publishers are <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-01-18/worlds-largest-education-company-crashes-after-dire-warning-warns-unprecedented-busi">cutting</a> their workforces and <a href="http://blog.taaonline.net/2016/08/changing-educational-publishing-industry-fraught-with-disruptors/">regrouping</a> to produce… <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/03/30/publishers-report-digital-sales-overtaking-print-sales">digital</a> materials!  </p>

<p><strong>Trend 2: Digital curricula is increasing. </strong></p>
<p>Curriculum drives K–12: </p>
<ul>
<li>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://cepr.harvard.edu/files/cepr/files/teaching-higher-report.pdf">Research</a></span> tells us that <em>high-quality, aligned instructional</em> material is important in helping teachers support their students…" <a href="http://k12education.gatesfoundation.org/2017/01/spotlight-on-partners-and-grantees-working-to-get-high-quality-aligned-instructional-materials-to-teachers/?utm_source=momentum&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter-2017-january&amp;utm_content=spotlight-on-partners-and-grantees-working-to-get-high-quality-aligned-instructional-materials-to-teachers">Bob Hughes</a>, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</li>
</ul>
<p>Teachers must have their curriculum! So as the paper-based curriculum industry is dying, the digital curriculum industry is emerging. For example, OER marketplaces (e.g., <a href="http://gooru.org/welcome/">gooru</a>, <a href="https://www.edmodo.com/">Edmodo</a>, <a href="http://www.ck12.org/">CK12</a>) that focus on OER content continue to expand (Amazon is about to open <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/28/technology/amazon-unveils-online-education-service-for-teachers.html?_r=0">Inspire</a>, an OER website), while organizations that provide full OER-based curricula are beginning to hit their stride (e.g., <a href="https://marketbrief.edweek.org/marketplace-k-12/the-k-12-marketplace-what-to-look-for-in-2016/">EngageNY</a>, <a href="https://thejournal.com/Articles/2017/03/24/Open-Up-Resources-EL-Education-to-Launch-Free-K5-ELA-Curriculum.aspx?p=1">Open Up</a>). The latter provide the curriculum free — since it is based on free OER materials — but make money, and stay afloat to produce more curricula, by providing PD and other support services. </p>
<p>And yes, teachers too are producing digital curriculum — though, we (as well as others, e.g., <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2015/12/04/research-move-to-digital-curriculum-calls-for-teacher-training-new-district-roles.aspx">Learning Counsel</a> and the <a href="http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1500/RR1529/RAND_RR1529.pdf">Rand Corp</a>) have voiced <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/09/06/reinventing-the-wheel.aspx">concern</a> on <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2017/01/03/memo-to-oer-purveyors.aspx">more</a> than one <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/04/05/school-day.aspx">occasion</a> about the challenges classroom teachers face in producing "high-quality" curriculum while doing the zillion other things teachers are already required to do. <a href="http://hechingerreport.org/common-cores-unintended-consequence/">Bill Schmidt</a>, a well-regarded, math ed researcher concurs: </p>
