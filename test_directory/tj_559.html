<p><a href="https://www.bloomington.k12.mn.us/">Bloomington Public Schools</a> has  selected a new student information system (SIS) following the discontinuation  of its previous SIS.</p>
<p>"Throughout the selection process, and  particularly during demonstrations, we looked at the various systems from a  user perspective," said John Weisser, the district's executive director of  technology and information services, in a prepared statement. "For  example, we considered the grade book options for teachers, the amount of  information available through portals to students and parents, and from an IT  perspective, system accessibility to raw data so we can format it for others to  use." Eventually, the district settled on <a href="https://www.infinitecampus.com/">Infinite Campus</a> "because it met our requirements and more," Weisser  concluded.</p>
<p>The online SIS  allows parents and students to access information from any Internet connected  device for proactive communication.</p>
<p>"Infinite Campus offers a well-developed  product and enhanced user experience for Bloomington stakeholders," added  Weisser. "Infinite Campus is a well-established company that knows the K12  environment well."</p>
