<p>A California school system will shortly deploy a final wave of new "zero client" displays in its computer labs to replace legacy computing
equipment. <a href="http://www.cnusd.k12.ca.us/site/default.aspx?PageID=1" target="_blank">Corona Norco Unified School District</a> chose
19-inch <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/commercial/desktop-virtualization/lg-19CNV42K-B" target="_blank">Cloud V Series Zero Client</a>
displays from <a href="http://www.lg.com/us" target="_blank">LG Electronics</a>. So far, the district has installed 2,300 units. It
anticipates rolling out another 2,000 to 3,500 monitors over the next 18 months.</p>
<p>This type of device doesn't run a full operating system. It connects to the network and pulls the display from a server, which takes care
of most of the processing. There is no CPU or local storage.</p>
<p>Price figured into the decision. According to Brian Troudy, director of networking and infrastructure at the district, "Across the board,
LG was able to offer us better prices for better quality." He estimated that competing products would have cost about a fifth more; and other
technology approaches would have been two and a half times costlier. The newer displays also consume far less power — 28 watts compared to
300 watts per computer.</p>

<p>Another factor: device management. Once they're deployed, the new displays can be managed from a central location.</p>
<p>"We have had a very smooth transition and relationship with LG, and look forward to completing our installations throughout our schools,"
Troudy added.</p>
