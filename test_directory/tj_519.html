<p>A new education platform for K-12 pulls together multiple  programs to ensure student data security and privacy. <a href="http://aegisidentity.com/identity-software/" target="_blank">Aegis Identity Software</a> has formally introduced <a href="http://aegisidentity.com/identity-software/products/eduzone/" target="_blank">EduZone</a>,  a combination of applications that provide a privatized data and application  management platform for schools and districts. The suite is already in use  within at least one Illinois district.</p>
<p>EduZone encompasses five programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>EZ Application Launcher is a single website  where users can log in to find all district-approved applications. Once they're  logged in they have access to all programs;</li>
<li>EZ Application Marketplace provides a one-stop  shop where users can look at the pool of applications being made available to  district people. When a given program is approved by the district, it will appear  in the application launcher;</li>
<li>EZ Identity enables the district to set up  "digital citizen" profiles for each user, giving that person access  to approved applications for as long as he or she is granted access by the  district. Likewise, access to all district network resources is cut off when  the status of that online persona is changed;</li>
<li>EZ Registry enables the district to control and  set up agreements with how applications may use and "persist" the  data. Application providers use the registry to make their applications  available in EduZone Marketplace and agree to the terms of use by the district;  and</li>
<li>EZ Data has an application programming interface  that facilitates data exchange among applications while ensuring the district  maintains control over the data.</li>
</ul>
