<p>When Tim Peltz took over directorship of Information Systems for the <a href="http://www.racine.k12.wi.us/" target="_blank">Racine Unified School District</a> in Wisconsin five years ago, Racine had a multitude of computing devices with the typical district mix: some that were 15 years old, some that were brand new, and a whole bunch in between.</p>
<p>Racine spent $1.7 million putting in a 10 gigabit fiber optic ring among 32 schools as a long-term lease deal, more than three-quarters of which was paid for through E-rate funding. All the district needed was new computers to exploit the potential.</p>
<p>So Peltz spent six to eight months pulling meetings together to convince district leaders that if they could collaborate with each other and give up individual departmental control over computer purchases (and the budget dedicated to those), it would save them money in the long run and make their operations more efficient, their staff more productive, and students and teachers happier about their in-classroom computing experiences. They finally agreed, the funding was pulled together, and Peltz and his crew spent an entire summer replacing 10,000 computers.</p>

<p>"It was probably the biggest technology-positive shift ever in this district," he noted.</p>
<p>Except over time it turned out not to be enough.</p>
<p><strong>The Infrastructure Bottleneck</strong><br/>
The main problem came down to the fact that Racine's wireless network design used centralized controllers for managing all of the access points (APs). The traffic would come to the six controllers in the district data center and then go back out to the school where the communication originated. That approach created a huge bottleneck.</p>
<p>As Peltz explained, "It worked fine when we first put it in. There weren't many devices and the applications being used weren't as bandwidth-intensive. As we started seeing more devices connecting to the wireless network — projectors, Apple TV streaming, even our phone network — things weren't working. It would take 20 minutes to get an entire cart of laptops online and to Google.com."</p>
<p>The challenge to find computers and study spaces only grew as more and more high school and some middle school students took advantage of online courses. In addition to students taking classes from the <a href="http://www.wisconsineschool.com/" target="_blank">Wisconsin eSchool Network</a>, local sections of online courses were created — all of which put pressure on the infrastructure by consuming ever greater amounts of bandwidth. Along with the content teacher, a mentor teacher at the student's school would provide support and encouragement to virtual students to make sure they were staying on track. That program is "huge," he says. "We're doubling if not tripling enrollment every single year."</p>
<p> Schools would continually put in work orders to supplement the wireless network with additional APs. But Peltz knew that wasn't the right approach. "Yes, they'd get on the network quicker, but there would still be that bottleneck of coming back to the main data center, hitting the controllers." Controller utilization was consistently between 90 percent and 95 percent from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. "every single day," he recalled.</p>
<p>So a year ago Peltz threw up his hands and, with the superintendent's approval, put the kibosh on new device acquisition. "We needed to stop ordering mobile devices until we got a plan for our in-building infrastructure that included our network switching and our wireless."</p>
<p>That device embargo is still in place until the last of three phases of an infrastructure refresh is completed, expected before school begins in fall 2014.</p>
<p>Here's how Peltz and his IT organization are approaching the work of upgrading their site to equipment designed for 802.11ac.</p>
<p><strong>This Time Around, Design for Capacity</strong><br/>
The previous wireless network was designed for convenience and coverage. It was never really meant to accommodate the 30 to 40 computers in a single classroom, all streaming high definition video, Peltz said.</p>
