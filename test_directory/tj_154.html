<p>Incident IQ has released an update to its cloud-based IT support and help desk system for K–12 schools and districts. The Winter 2018 update includes a range of new features for teachers, IT staff and administrators.</p>
<p>Among the enhancements in the latest release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Ticket Wizard, designed to make it easier for teachers and other end users to submit support requests;</li>
<li>Automatic population of fields when submitting tickers;</li>
<li>Quick Tickets, which lets end users submit help requests via their dashboard;</li>
<li>Ticket templates, for rapidly generating new types of tickets, along with templates designed for use for recurring IT tasks, such as maintenance;</li>
<li>New analytics capabilities for administrators via Analytics Explorer, which, according to the company, "has been enhanced to provide an even greater insight into a district's technology performance. New overview pages allow leaders to quickly generate side-by-side comparisons of locations, agents, or model performance. Incident IQ's enhanced Service Level Agreement (SLA) management tools allow for easy SLA implementation, monitoring, and reporting."</li>
