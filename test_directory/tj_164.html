<p>Global PC sales reached 67.2 million units in the third quarter of this  year, marking a 0.5 percent decrease over the same period last year, according  to a new report from <a href="https://www.idc.com/" target="_blank">International Data Corp.</a> (IDC). The slight reduction is better than the 1.4-percent drop IDC previously  projected and represents a wider trend of market stabilization, according to  the company.</p>
<p>Closer to home, the traditional PC market (which includes notebooks,  desktops and workstations) in the United States saw shipments of 16.6 million  units, with notebook sales dropping noticeably and desktops outperforming  forecasts.</p>
<p>"The U.S. traditional PC market exhibited lower overall growth,  contracting 3.4 percent in 3Q17," said Neha Mahajan, senior research  analyst for devices &amp; displays, in a prepared statement. "Despite the  overall contraction, Chromebooks remain a source of optimism as the category  gains momentum in sectors outside education, especially in retail and financial  services."</p>
<p>Other mature and emerging markets also struggled, with the exceptions of  Japan, Canada and Latin America.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hp.com/country/us/en/welcome.html" target="_blank">HP</a> led the  market, with 15.3 million shipments and a 22.8 percent market share. Those  numbers are up from 14.4 million shipments and 21.4 percent of the market  during the same period last year.</p>
<p>"HP was the only top vendor to manage a notable shipment increase  with growth of 6 percent on the year," according to information released  by IDC.</p>

<p>In second place, <a href="https://www3.lenovo.com/us/en/" target="_blank">Lenovo</a> moved 14.5 million machines to capture 21.6 percent of the market in 2017's  third quarter, marking a year-over-year improvement of .1 percent.</p>
<p>Lenovo "continued to struggle in North America," according to a news  release, "with weak notebook sales, but also seemed to have slowed its  recent decline in Asia/Pacific."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dell.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Dell</a> sold 10.8 million units  in the most recent quarter, improving its market share to 16.1 percent from  15.6 percent during last year's third quarter.</p>
<p>Apple held the fourth spot with 4.9 million sales and a 7.3 percent  share, a slight improvement on the 7.2 percent share it held for the third  quarter of last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.asus.com/us/" target="_blank">Asus</a> was the only company in the  top five to see a decline faster than market average. The company sold 4.2  million units during this year's third quarter for 6.2 percent of the market. During  the same period last year, the company shipped 4.9 million units and accounted  for 7.3 percent of the market.</p>
<p>"The traditional PC market performed much as expected in the third  quarter," said Loren Loverde, program vice president for worldwide PCD trackers,  in a prepared statement. "Emerging markets rebounded slightly more than  anticipated, but overall results reflect the stabilization we expected  following component and inventory adjustments. The outlook for the fourth  quarter remains cautious, likely with a small decline in volume for the quarter  and the year. The gains in emerging regions and potential for more commercial  replacements represent some upside potential, although we continue to expect  incremental declines in total shipments for the next few years."</p>
