<p>The <a href="http://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a>’s <a href="http://rossier.usc.edu/" target="_blank">Rossier School of Education</a> Monday unveiled a new partnership with <a href="http://www.tomorrow.org/" target="_blank">Project Tomorrow</a> that will support the nonprofit education organization’s research and help drive future innovation in K–12 schools.</p>
<p>Each year, Project Tomorrow’s <a href="http://www.tomorrow.org/speakup/" target="_blank">Speak Up Research Project for Digital Learning</a> collects feedback from K–12 educators, students, parents, district administrators, principals, technology leaders, librarians and other education professionals about the role technology plays for learning both inside and outside the classroom. Since 2003, educators at more than 30,000 schools have used Speak Up’s research findings, which include insights from 5 million survey participants, according to the project website. In addition, federal, state and local decision-makers use the data to inform education policy and programs.</p>
