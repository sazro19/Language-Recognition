<p class="deck" id="ph_pcontent3_3_Deck">With more and more students using mobile devices for learning, districts are finding creative ways to provide enough bandwidth for everyone to do their work outside of school.</p>

<p>The Internet has reached virtually every American school, but problems of bandwidth and connectivity persist. Despite more than 17 years of government subsidy via E-rate, a recent Consortium for School Networking (CoSN) <a href="http://www.cosn.org/about-cosn">survey</a> revealed that a whopping 99 percent of districts still "needed more bandwidth." Rich Kaestner, project director for Washington, DC-based CoSN, attributed the bandwidth shortfall to a relentless need to feed the digital beast. Digital curricula, 1-to-1 programs, bring your own technology (BYOT) initiatives and Common Core textbooks are driving a growing crowd of students and teachers online, both at school and at home. But what can schools do about those homes that don't have Internet connectivity? </p>
<p><strong>'A Big Distance for a Little Money'</strong><br/>
In the rural areas of America, bandwidth problems revolve around price and availability. According to Kaestner, "Providers are not anxious to cover rural areas because it's a big distance for a little money. To make it worthwhile, providers have to charge more, or have some sort of incentive to provide service." </p>

<p> While the E-rate program, funded by federal phone taxes, has helped to bridge this financial gap, John Harrington, CEO of <a href="https://www.fundsforlearning.com/">Funds For Learning</a>, said he believes that the program must adjust to changing times and burgeoning need. In 2013 alone, Funds For Learning estimated, 8,169 rural school districts applied for E-rate funds. These applicants represent an enrollment of 11.77 million students at 33,693 school sites. Harrington said, "The challenge that rural schools (and every school that receives E-rate funding) are facing is that the program has not been adjusted significantly since its inception. We've seen the demand for Internet access triple, while the program itself has only increased about five percent in terms of funding support." </p>
<p> According to Harrington, many rural schools are looking to expand bandwidth by installing fiber optics, either between buildings or across parts of the community. "They have to negotiate right of way, or even crossing rail road tracks," he said. "That's where it takes a lot of work and leadership in the local community. It may take five years. In many cases, the community may look to bond funds or other sources in addition to the E-rate program to get that funding in place." </p>
<p><strong>E-Rate Doesn't Hit Home</strong><br/>
Cell phone data plans, apps for tablets, and home Internet access capabilities have changed radically since the inception of E-rate. And yet, as of 2014, E-rate dollars may not be used to help students connect to the Web at home. In an era of online textbooks and online homework assignments, lack of home access can be a major problem. </p>
<p> When technology experts at <a href="http://www.barrington220.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1">Barrington 220 School District</a> (IL), went looking for solutions, they spoke with Comcast representatives about <a href="http://internetessentials.com/">Internet Essentials</a>, a two-year-old program that has provided Internet access for 4,000 school districts and 250,000 low-income households.</p>
<p> Tom Leonard, superintendent of Barrington 220, a 9,200-student district in northwest Chicago, eventually embraced the Comcast program that offers significantly reduced monthly Internet fees for families with children on free and reduced lunch. Even though families can keep the monthly $9.95 monthly Essentials rate until the youngest child in the family reaches 18, there were still problems. </p>
<p> "For some families, $9.95 a month is still too much," Leonard said. "Also, one hard-wired computer per family doesn't necessarily work in our world anymore. If I'm giving kids iPads and MacBook Airs to bring home, those are not hard-wired devices. They work in a wireless environment. Even if you did hardwire one of them, you can only have one computer on that hard-wired system at a time. You need a router." </p>
