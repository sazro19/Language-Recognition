<p>Malware will grow. Attacks on Android and other mobile  devices will continue. And payment platforms and the Internet of Things will  become sources for new kinds of vulnerabilities. These are all  predictions from security vendor <a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/" target="_blank">Panda  Software</a> for the new year.</p>
<p>Panda security researchers predict rapid continued growth of  new forms of malware, particularly code tucked inside JavaScript and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/mt173057.aspx" target="_blank">PowerShell</a>.  The latter is a Windows 10 automation tool that allows scripts to be executed,  which, Panda reported, "could be used to attack users."</p>
<p>Cyber criminals will also turn to tried and true methods  such as the use of exploit kits to reach as many people and machines as  possible. That reach will include malware on smartphones, especially on  Android, the most popular mobile operating system on the market, Panda  predicted.</p>
<p>"Although Android attacks have been commonplace in  recent years, the news for 2016 is the manner in which mobiles will be  infected. We will see more threats that root the device, which makes  eliminating it a near impossible task for an antivirus, except for those that  come installed from the factory", said Luis Corrons, a technical director at  PandaLabs, the company's research arm, in a press release.</p>

<p>The Internet of Things and mobile payment will also become the  newest target. The company pointed to the 2015 coverage of cars whose software  is connected to the Internet, which allowed for the remote control of the  vehicle. Two coders showed how to exploit vulnerabilities in the onboard  computers of a Jeep Cherokee in order to control the vehicle, including  applying the brakes.</p>
<p>As IoT builds in popularity and increasing numbers of  devices are connected online, criminals will seek out new vectors for gaining  access to personal and enterprise networks. "If any of the platforms  becomes more popular compared to the others, it will be the first one to be  looked at by the attackers as they search for weaknesses in its system,"  noted Corrons.</p>
<p>Thieves will also hunt out vulnerabilities on mobile payment  platforms, Panda suggested, as easy ways to "steal money directly."</p>
