<p><a href="http://www.sbcss.k12.ca.us/" target="_blank">San Bernardino County Superintendent
of Schools</a> (SBCSS), which serves 33 K-12 districts in San Bernardino
County, CA, has overhauled its technology infrastructure to support various
initiatives, including the continued implementation of the <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/" target="_blank">Common Core State Standards</a> and <a href="http://www.smarterbalanced.org/" target="_blank">Smarter Balanced</a> online
assessments.</p>
<p>SBCSS delivers educational services to more than 412,000 students and 17,000
teachers, administrators and staff at more than 500 schools. With the
implementation of the Common Core and Smarter Balanced assessments, SBCSS found
the need to upgrade the hardware and software in its data center, network and
schools.</p>
<p>To support these initiatives, the team at SBCSS selected a mix of end-to-end
solutions from Dell and VMware. In the process, they were able to reduce the
number of physical servers in the data center to six and run to up to 130
virtual servers. They also improved overall network capacity and reduced
latency to support increasing connectivity demands arising from new Common Core
curriculum and assessment testing.</p>

<p>SBCSS's new end-to-end infrastructure includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/04/blade-server-solutions?ST=+server%20+blades&amp;dgc=ST&amp;cid=265289&amp;lid=4829825&amp;acd=1230980794347400" target="_blank">Dell
    PowerEdge blade servers</a> to support SBCSS's VMware virtualization
    infrastructure;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/04/campaigns/networking" target="_blank">Dell
    Networking</a> solutions to increase network capacity and connectivity at
    both the edges and core of its county-wide network;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/equallogic-ps-series" target="_blank">Dell
    EqualLogic</a> storage arrays to support the increasing volume of data;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/poweredge-vrtx/pd" target="_blank">Dell
    PowerEdge VRTX</a> integrated server, storage, networking and management
    solutions to augment and replace remote file servers;</li>
<li><a href="http://software.dell.com/kace/" target="_blank">Dell KACE Systems Management Appliances</a> to improve endpoint security, inventory, system
    configuration, operating systems deployment, remote systems management and
    help desk capabilities; and</li>
<li><a href="http://marketing.sonicwall.com/documents/sonicwall-supermassive-next-generation-firewall-series-datasheet-24535.pdf" target="_blank">Dell
    SonicWALL SuperMassive Firewalls</a> to protect the county-wide network
    from viruses, spam, spyware, intrusions and other threats.</li>
</ul>
<p>Administrators, faculty, staff and students in the district use Dell
desktops, laptops, Chromebooks and Macintosh computers, and SBCSS recently
completed a major migration of its Windows machines from Windows XP to Windows
7. According to information from Dell, the Dell KACE Systems Management
Appliances "enabled the IT team to reduce OS deployment time for a single
machine from over 24 hours to 30-to-60 minutes, including building user profile
data." The KACE appliances also simplified the process of flagging unauthorized
software and automatically executing a software removal script when the
affected computer logs on to the network.</p>
<p>"The end-to-end Dell solutions we've implemented allow us to give
better, more reliable and faster service to our customers, whether
they're teachers and students in the classroom, our administrative staff
or other needs that this organization has on a spur-of-the-moment basis,"
said Ted Alejandre, superintendent of SBCSS, in a prepared statement.</p>
