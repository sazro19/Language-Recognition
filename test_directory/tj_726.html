<p>The <a href="http://www.ck12.org/" target="_blank">CK-12 Foundation</a>, a nonprofit 
organization that develops open source software for education, has introduced 
free math and science adaptive practice apps for iOS and Android devices, 
expanding the platform beyond its existing Web apps for Windows 8 and 
Chromebooks.</p>
<p>The apps provide students with practice problems in middle and high school 
math and science subjects, including arithmetic, algebra, geometry, 
trigonometry, calculus, biology, chemistry and physics. The apps adjust problems 
and suggest learning materials based on individual performance. Teachers and 
parents can monitor student progress through the company's site, which tracks 
student progress and includes reports on the number of easy, medium and hard 
questions each student completed successfully.</p>
<p>The CK-12 Foundation has also partnered with learning management system company <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/" target="_blank">Blackboard</a> to make CK-12 
content available to schools through Blackboard's cross-platform learning object 
repository, <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/sites/xplor/k12.html" target="_blank">xpLor</a>. 
Initially, Blackboard will offer CK-12's geometry, algebra, biology and 
chemistry content, with more subjects to follow. Teachers and students can use 
CK-12 to access more than 100,000 customizable digital textbooks, interactive 
content and digital simulations. Teachers can also use the platform to create 
their own assessments. CK-12 content will be available to Blackboard users at no 
cost. </p>
