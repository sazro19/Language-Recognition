<p>Two thirds (67 percent) of parents say monitoring their children’s media use is more important than respecting their privacy, according to a report released Tuesday by <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org" target="_blank">Common Sense Media</a>. More than two in five parents (41 percent) say they check their children’s devices and social media accounts “always” or “most of the time.” </p>
<p>The report, “<a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/uploads/research/common-sense-parent-census_whitepaper_for-web.pdf" target="_blank">The Common Sense Census: Plugged-In Parents of Tweens and Teens</a>” — a collaboration with the Center on Media and Human Development at <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu" target="_blank">Northwestern University</a> — examined the screen time for children ages 8-18, as well as their parents.</p>
<p>Some other key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parents of tweens and teens say they spend more than nine hours a day with screen media;</li>
<li>78 percent of those parents say they believe they are good media and technology role models for their children;</li>
<li>Many parents are concerned about their children’s social media use and other online activities — for example, they worry that their children may become addicted to technology (56 percent) and say they believe that technology use negatively impacts their children’s sleep (34 percent);</li>
<li>Fifty percent of parents indicated they thought that using social media hurts children’s physical activity;</li>
<li>Hispanic/Latino parents tend to be more aware and more concerned, and they say they manage their children’s media use more than white or African American parents; and </li>
<li>94 percent have positive attitudes about the role of technology in their children’s education.</li>
