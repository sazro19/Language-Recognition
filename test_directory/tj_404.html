<p>The global education gamification market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 66.22 percent from 2016 through 2020, according to a new <a href="http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/dmbvxf/global_education" target="_blank">report</a> by Dublin-based market research firm <a href="http://www.researchandmarkets.com" target="_blank">Research and Markets</a>.</p>
<p>Gamification is the application of game mechanics into non-gaming contexts to drive user engagement and to enhance problem solving. Points, badges, leaderboards, challenges and rewards are some examples of game mechanics.</p>
<p>Gamification does not create brand new, real-world games, according to an R&amp;M news release, but uses game techniques to engage students in comprehensive learning mechanisms.</p>
<p>The report, “<a href="http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/dmbvxf/global_education" target="_blank">Global Education Gamification Market 2016-2020</a>,” covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the education gamification market over the next four years. To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue generated from the sales of gamification solutions within the ed market.</p>
