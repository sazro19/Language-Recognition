<p>Worldwide server shipments grew 13 percent and revenue  17.9 percent in
the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, according to
the information technology research and advisory company <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3063417" target="_blank">Gartner</a>.</p>
<p>The reason for the growth is strong demand from the hyperscale server market
in North America, according to Gartner. Because of the strong American dollar,
server sales and shipments in that region were enough to offset declines in
Latin America and Japan and minimal growth in Europe, the Middle East and
Africa (EMEA). The first quarter of 2015 saw the "strongest shipment growth
since the third quarter of 2010" and "the second-largest-volume quarter ever,"
said Adrian O'Connell, research director at Gartner, in a prepared
statement.</p>
<p>Server shipments and revenue by CPU type:</p>
<ul>
<li>x86 server shipments increased by 13.2 percent and revenue increased by
    14.5 percent compared to the first quarter of 2014;</li>
<li>RISC/Itanium Unix server shipments declined by 2.9 percent and revenue
    declined by 3.1 percent; and</li>
<li>Other types of servers, particularly mainframes, increased revenue by
    95.1 percent.</li>
</ul>
