<p><a href="http://www.biamp.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Biamp Systems</a> has upgraded its <a href="http://www.biamp.com/products/tesira/" target="_blank">Tesira</a> digital signal processing platform to include two new hardware components and  new compression abilities.</p>
<p>The hardware components, the "EX-AEC Expander and the EEC-4 Modular Card for the EX-MOD  device," according to a news release, "bring Biamp Sona AEC  technology directly to the endpoints for easy and efficient AEC and a greater  variety in the way systems can be deployed."</p>
<p>The company has  also added multi-channel compression capability and the ability to use  compressors in simplified or advanced mode at startup. "A new independent  limiter block provides more precise decision-making when choosing blocks needed  for the installation," according to a news release.</p>
<p>"By  providing the most flexible and scalable AVB networking capabilities in the  industry, Tesira 2.1 ensures that there is a Biamp solution for every project  and Biamp quality for every budget," said Justin O'Connor, audio product  manager at Biamp, in a news release. "With the latest Tesira technology,  enterprises can take audio processing from large to super-scaled platforms that  provide functionality such as AVB, CobraNet, and Dante in a single Tesira  chassis."</p>
