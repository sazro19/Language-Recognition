<p>Adoption of Mac and iPad devices is increasing in K-12 education, driven
primarily by the app ecosystem and user preference, according to a new report
from <a href="http://www.jamfsoftware.com/" target="_blank">JAMF Software</a>.</p>
<p>The report, "<a href="http://www.jamfsoftware.com/2015-survey-managing-apple-devices-in-education/" target="_blank">2015
Survey: Managing Apple Devices in Education</a>," is based on the results of
JAMF Software's second annual survey of IT professionals in K-12 education
organizations.</p>
<p>The report attributes the growth in popularity of Macs and iPads in the
classroom to "Apple’s rich app ecosystem, overall appeal and user
preference, native security features, and the reduction of overall costs
associated with device maintenance."</p>
<p>Key findings from the report:</p>
<ul>
<li>94 percent of respondents said their schools support Mac computers, while
    89 percent support PCs and 36 percent support Chromebooks;</li>
<li>97 percent of respondents said their schools support iPads, while 35
    percent support Android tablets and 32 percent support Windows tablets;</li>
<li>K-12 respondents reported an increase in the usage of Mac (42 percent)
    and iPad (36 percent) in 2015;</li>
<li>61 percent of respondents said Mac is easier to manage than other
    computer platforms and 67 percent said iPad is easier to manage than other
    tablets; and</li>

    platforms and 80 percent said iPad is more secure than other tablets.</li>
