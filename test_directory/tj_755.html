<p><a href="http://www.splashtop.com/" target="_blank">Splashtop</a> has launched <a href="http://www.mirroring360.com/mirroring-assist" target="_blank">Mirror Assist</a> and an  update to <a href="http://www.mirroring360.com/" target="_blank">Mirroring360</a> designed to  help larger schools more easily implement and manage the screen sharing  solution.</p>
<p>"Mirroring  Assist enables the use of a QR-code based discovery to connect the iOS devices  with the computers, bypassing Bonjour," according to a news release. "You  can mirror your iPad or iPhone screens across different subnets and VLANs as  long as the networks are routable."</p>
<p>The new tool  eliminates the need for IT staff to reconfigure the network for Bonjour and  allows Bonjour broadcast to be disabled, reducing unnecessary traffic</p>
<p>"Mirroring360  solves many of our problems of connecting an iPad on our school network. We  have worked for a very long time trying to get AirPlay to work with no success,"  said Rick Meyer, technology facilitator and instructor at <a href="http://www.sidneyraiders.org/education/district/district.php?sectionid=1" target="_blank">Sidney  Public Schools</a>, in a prepared statement. "Finally there is something  that is easy to use and isn't a burden on our IT staff."</p>
