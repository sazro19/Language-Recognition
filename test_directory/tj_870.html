<p>A
private middle school in Corning, NY is the site of the first full
rollout of
the <a href="www.samsung.com" target="_blank">Samsung</a> <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/business/by-industry/education-solutions/SOL00000000000000043" target="_blank">School Digital
Learning Initiative</a>.</p>
<p>Beginning
with
the recently opened school year, the <a href="www.tasms.com" target="_blank">Alternative
School for Math and
Science</a> (ASMS) is the recipient of Galaxy tablets for its 110
students,
interactive whiteboards, wireless printers and other hardware and
educational
software from Samsung.<br/>

<p>"In
seeing
the highly innovative educational program offered by ASMS, we found
clear alignment with Samsung's commitment to dynamic learning
environments that
raise student engagement, foster collaboration and enable personalized
learning," said Tod Pike, senior vice president at Samsung's Enterprise
Business Division.</p>

<p>The
new
system allows students to share their work with other students on
tablets
or with the whole class on the whiteboards, allows teachers to track
student
progress and deadlines easily and even reminds students that they have
to turn
in permission slips they should have had their parents sign the night
before.</p>
<p>Kim
Frock,
a founder of the school, which opened in 2004, and its non-paid
administrative head, called the new system "the most comprehensive
digital
solution available in education today."</p>
<p><a href="www.corning.com" target="_blank">Corning</a>, the major corporate employer in the upstate New York
area, and Samsung
shared the cost of the implementation, according to school officials.</p>
<p>Frock
is
married to Wendell P. Weeks, Corning's chairman and CEO. More than half
the
10- to 14-year-olds who attend the school are the children of Corning
employees.</p>
<p>Corning
Inc.
has made substantial contributions to the school in the past, including
$6.7 million in 2012 for renovations and upgrades.</p>
