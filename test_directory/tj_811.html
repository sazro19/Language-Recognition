<p><a href="http://www.autodesk.com/" target="_blank">Autodesk</a> has released its design software free to students, instructors and educational  institutions anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>"The way we make things is changing  rapidly, and we need a workforce ready to design for new manufacturing and  construction techniques. By providing free professional design tools to  students, faculty members and academic institutions around the world, we're  helping get industry ready for the next phase," said Carl Bass, Autodesk  CEO, in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>Available to secondary and post-secondary schools,  the offer follows the company's <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/campaigns/design-the-future-us/home" target="_blank">February release</a> of $250 million in 3D design software and project-based curricula for middle  schools and high schools in the United States as part of President Obama's  ConnectED initiative.</p>
<p>The company  "is also helping schools move to the cloud by providing academic  institutions with its full suite of next generation cloud-based design products,  cloud services such as the <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/a360/overview" target="_blank">A360</a> collaboration platform, as well as maintenance subscription  for free," according to a news release.</p>

<p>Students  at <a href="http://apsva.us/swanson" target="_blank">Swanson Middle School</a> have used  Autodesk tools to <a href="http://inthefold.autodesk.com/in_the_fold/2014/07/middle-school-students-using-autodesk-fusion-360-software-develop-device-to-aid-local-man.html" target="_blank">help  create a tool</a> designed to help a local man with disabilities use a  touchscreen to communicate and college students have <a href="http://inthefold.autodesk.com/in_the_fold/2014/11/a-sustainable-foundation-for-learning-in-the-real-world.html" target="_blank">used  them</a> to design environmentally sustainable homes for an international  competition.</p>
<p>In an  effort to help educators integrate the tools, the company is also offering free  resources and content for project-based learning via its <a href="http://digitalsteam.autodesk.com/" target="_blank">Digital STEAM Workshop</a> and <a href="http://academy.autodesk.com/" target="_blank">Design Academy</a> initiatives.</p>
<p>"Our students are using <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview" target="_blank">Fusion 360</a> to  design an energy scooter which we are bringing to market via Kickstarter, and  they're only in 8th grade! If we can help more classroom teachers incorporate  learning through design in their curriculum, and technologies that engage  students in problem-solving through engineering, students will see how math and  science are springboards to careers as future innovators and entrepreneurs,"  said Karen Kaun, founder of <a href="http://www.makeosity.com/" target="_blank">Makeosity</a>,  in a prepared statement.</p>
