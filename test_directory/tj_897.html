<p>A  few years ago, districts across the country shared a simple goal: get iPads  into the hands of as many students as possible. With the rollouts complete,  early adopters are finding new uses for the tablets, chief among them  professional development. Here, we look at how three districts are using the  Apple ecosystem to help keep their educators up to speed on technology and  teaching.</p>
<p><strong>Flipping and Blending </strong><br/>
<a href="http://www.ccsdschools.com" target="_blank">Charleston County School District</a> in  South Carolina uses iPads to administer flipped PD to its teachers. Kristen  Brittingham, the district's director of personal mastery learning, said, "We  give them the content knowledge in advance and then take the PD to a higher  level at the face-to-face sessions."</p>
<p>Brittingham  said that her district also uses iPads to deliver blended learning for teachers  who are taking recertification and graduate courses. Using <a href="https://www.edmodo.com/" target="_blank">Edmodo</a> as a content platform, the district  holds face-to-face sessions and supports them with iPad-based learning materials.  "We'll work with teachers for two to three days over the summer,"  said Brittingham, "knowing that that they won't be able to retain  everything they've learned and/or fully understand it."</p>

<p>To  fill in that gap, Charleston County gathers all of the modules covered during  the intensive, multiday sessions and breaks the content down into "mini  courses." For a course on how to create a shared vision, for example, the  district has developed an <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/ipad/itunes-u/" target="_blank">iTunes U</a> course on a  dedicated channel it has been using for two years. The course includes pictures  of 10 different shared visions, an explanation of the differences among them  and the steps required to develop such visions. </p>
<p>Brittingham  said that being able to deliver the supporting materials via iOS lets her  department take the education deeper, while also providing a refresher lesson  for participants who need it. "It helps us deliver larger chunks of PD  that our teachers can go back and review as needed," she said. Over time,  she added, the iTunes U channel has morphed from being a district-led  initiative to one that's largely individualized by the teachers who use it. "Once  they download the courses to their iPads," said Brittingham, "they  can pick and choose the handouts, videos, audio, presentations and templates  that they need and focus on what's important to them as individuals."</p>
<p>Although  there was a period of adjustment to iOS-based PD, Brittingham said that now, "Being  able to provide electronic resources in a systemic manner has become part of our  ongoing support for our school system." She has seen good results and  heard positive feedback from teachers who now have a support mechanism for  their PD. "They're not just sitting in sessions and then walking away and  never hearing about the content again," she said. "Instead, teachers  now have the takeaways and materials right at their fingertips when they need  them."</p>
<p><strong>24/7 Support for Teachers</strong><br/>
Professional  development delivered via iOS isn't limited to the flipped or blended learning  environment. In Castle Rock, CO, <a href="https://www.dcsdk12.org/" target="_blank">Douglas  County School District </a> deploys  on-site PD professionals to come up with innovative ways to deliver instruction  to the district's teachers. </p>
<p>According  to Elizabeth Walhof, the district's professional development coordinator, one  such effort found teachers using iPads to create differentiated tasks for the  classroom. They shot videos, created iMovie trailers and used other mechanisms  to create tasks that allow different students to follow different learning  paths. "Teachers loved being able to use technology [tools] within the PD  just like they use those tools with their own students," said Walhof. "They  can put themselves in the student's role and use technology in a similar  fashion." </p>
