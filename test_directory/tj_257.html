<p>Magiera created an ed tech blog called “<a href="http://www.teachinglikeits2999.com" target="_blank">Teaching Like It’s 2999</a>,” and is the author of a well-reviewed book on innovative teaching, “<a href="https://us.corwin.com/en-us/nam/courageous-edventures/book247884" target="_blank">Courageous Edventures</a>.” She has also delivered a TEDx talk titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olOVzE0ujJ8" target="_blank">Power to the Pupil</a>,” and has appeared multiple times on television and radio.  </p>
<p>And get this: She’s only 33. (She turns 34 later this month.)</p>
<p>Currently, Magiera serves as chief innovation officer for <a href="http://d62.org" target="_blank">Des Plaines Public School District 62</a>, representing 12 schools on the north side of Chicago. Starting July 1, she will be chief program officer for <a href="https://www.edtechteam.com" target="_blank">EdTechTeam</a>, a global network of educational technologists dedicated to helping other educators, based in Irvine, CA.</p>
<p>Magiera will deliver the Tuesday keynote speech during the <a href="http://conference.iste.org/2017/" target="_blank">International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) conference</a>, 8:30-9:45 a.m. June 27. <em>THE Journal</em> caught up with Magiera and asked her about her approaches to education, technology, and bringing power back to the pupil. </p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> What does it mean to be a chief innovation officer for a school district?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jennie Magiera:</strong> Basically, it’s like a chief technology officer. Technology and IT report to me. I oversee technology for learning and also the infrastructure side. </p>
<p>I have also been a classroom teacher. I taught fourth and fifth grade, and math and science intermediate grades — third, fourth, fifth, sixth grades.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> You’re giving the keynote speech Tuesday, June 27, at ISTE. What are you going to talk about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Magiera:</strong> That’s a great question. I’m still working on it. Right now, something I’m thinking about — I actually have my planning posted in front of me — I’m talking about our stories, and “<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story#t-482470" target="_blank">The Danger of a Single Story</a>” by Chaminanda Ngozi Adichie, a Nigerian author.</p>
<p>The danger of the single story means oftentimes people only have a single story of each other, each other’s culture, their own people’s culture too.</p>
<p>But she also found that she had a single story — a middle class Nigerian home, with someone who could cook and clean. Her story inspired me to think about this keynote. I thought about the stories that we have of each other in education, as a society. I think that we have a lot of single stories about each other.</p>
