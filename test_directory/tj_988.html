<p>The courses are integrated with the company's personalized learning platform, <a href="http://www.getfueled.com/products-services/technology" target="_blank">Peak</a>. Teachers can further customize the courses by adding open educational resources or itemss from Peak's library, which includes more than 5,500 lessons and assessments.</p>
<p>"Designed with the diverse needs of middle school students in mind, each course uses engaging elements to create a sense of community and encourages students to be proactive in their learning, while the portfolio component requires that students set goals and reflect on progress toward those goals," said Jessica Hall, former middle school teacher and Fuel Education's senior manager of curriculum and design, in a prepared statement. "These courses will prepare students for high school and beyond."</p>
