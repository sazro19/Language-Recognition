<p><a href="http://www.discoveryeducation.com">Discovery Education</a>, a provider of digital content and professional development for K–12 classrooms, invites administrators and educators across North America to participate in the <a href="http://www.dayofdiscoverytour.com/">Day of Discovery Tour</a>, which kicks off April 29.</p>
<p>A series of free, full-day professional development opportunities, the Day of Discovery Tour is designed to help teachers and administrators learn more about integrating digital content into their curricula, provide opportunities for participants to share strategies that are working and connect attendees to their most valuable resource — each other.</p>
<p>This year’s Day of Discovery Tour will commence with two simultaneous events in Columbia, SC and Chicago, IL. Attendees can expect a day full of networking sessions, interactive demonstrations, open discussions and opportunities to learn from other education leaders’ testimonials and experiences. The tour will make additional stops from May through November in Columbia, TN; Salisbury, NC; Garland, TX; Stockton, CA; Surrey, British Columbia; Marana, AZ; and Rochester, NY.
