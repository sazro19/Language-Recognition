<p><img alt="Christopher Piehler" src="/-/media/EDU/THEJournal/Images/2014/03/20140317_ChristopherPiehler.jpg" style="width: 150px; height: 201px; float: left; margin-right: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>Ever since cable giant Comcast announced its intention of buying fellow media monolith Time Warner for $45 billion, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/katrina-vanden-heuvel-comcast-time-warner-doesnt-pass-the-smell-test/2014/02/18/4b00e120-9808-11e3-afce-3e7c922ef31e_story.html">industry watchers</a> have pointed out how the merger has the potential to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/13/tech/web/comcast-time-warner-consumer-impact/">harm customers</a>. Senator Al Franken wrote a <a href="http://www.franken.senate.gov/files/letter/140227FCCLetterComcastTWC.pdf">letter</a> to the FCC saying that Comcast “has a history of breaching its legal obligations to consumers.” Some rough <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/02/why-comcasttime-warner-cable-should-be-blocked.html">numbers</a> also suggest that the merger would violate antitrust law.<br/>
            <br/>
On the other hand, Comcast appears to be making <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/03/03/comcast-this-is-why-regulators-should-approve-the-time-warner-cable-merger/">an effort</a> to be a good corporate citizen. In February, in addition to renewing its vow to maintain Net neutrality, the company voluntarily <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/comcast-indefinitely-extends-low-cost-broadband-for-poor-families/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1&amp;">extended</a> its <a href="http://www.internetessentials.com/">Internet Essentials</a> program, which offers $9.95-a-month Internet service to families that qualify for free and reduced lunch.<br/>
            <br/>
That’s a nice gesture, but if you ask me, it’s not enough. With more and more students learning on ever-cheaper mobile devices, <a href="http://thejournal.realviewdigital.com/?iid=86273#folio=27">bandwidth</a> is poised to be the biggest equity issue in education, and Comcast’s bid for Time Warner is an opportunity to resolve that issue in one fell swoop.<br/>
            <br/>
So if I were a member of the FCC team reviewing this merger (and let’s all take a moment to be thankful that I’m not), I would resort to some good, old-fashioned blackmail. I would decree that Comcast can buy Time Warner if and only if the combined company pledges to provide <em>free</em> home Internet service to every family that qualifies for free and reduced lunch — oh, and free connectivity to every public K-12 school in the country. </p>

<p>Is this a lot to ask? Yup. Is requiring a company to give away its services ethical? Probably not. But is it ideal to give one company control of Internet access to what <a href="http://www.freepress.net/blog/2014/02/25/six-myths-about-comcast-time-warner-cable-merger">some experts</a> say would be 60 percent of American homes? Definitely not. But I believe that free bandwidth for education would be worth all the risks that this deal entails. I’d love to hear what you think.
