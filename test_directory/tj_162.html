<li><strong>Classroom Teacher:</strong>  "May I &lt;fill in the blank, e.g., use a piece of software I found with my class, request a website be permitted for viewing, etc.&gt;"</li>
<li><strong>IT Staff: </strong>"No." </li>
</ul>
<p>We have all had conversations with the school/district IT folks that were not as wonderful as we might have wanted. And, we may have walked away from those conversations thinking non-wonderful thoughts about the IT folks — to put it mildly. </p>
<p style="margin-top: 12pt;">Why do IT staff seem to always say "no?" Taking a lesson from kindergarten, where we learned that talking with others is a good way to better understand them, we set up some lunches with IT staff from several different schools and districts. Our thought was this: IT have their priorities, their responsibilities, their resources. If we could better understand those priorities, responsibilities, and resources, then maybe we could work together better — maybe we could understand where the “no” comes from and the next time we ask for something, we can help IT to say "yes" by framing the request in a way that is more aligned with their priorities, responsibilities, and resources. (Shout-out to ES’s and CN’s kindergarten teachers!)</p>

<p>So, besides having enjoyable lunches of Korean food, Turkish food, etc., we did gain some insight into the priorities, responsibilities, and resources that drive/constrain IT staff. In what follows then, we (1) identify the major tasks that IT staff do behind the scenes, so to speak, and (2) identify the <em>new</em> <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2017/08/21/good-luck-finding-any.aspx">demands</a> that <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2017/10/02/nevada-is-leading-the-way.aspx">1-to-1</a> is placing on them.  </p>
<p>Here is a list of the major tasks that the IT staff in a school district are involved in: </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Device management:</strong> IT must deal with configuring new devices and maintaining devices. A major challenge is dealing with aging devices and multiples types of devices (e.g., iPads, Windows laptops, and Google Chromebooks). </li>
<li><strong>Network management:</strong> IT must deal constantly with bandwidth issues, security, and filtering. There are constant updates to the network software — and again, there are new access points and old access points that need TLC.  </li>
<li><strong>Resource Management: </strong> IT must manage all the educational software that is licensed – and make sure that no license agreements are abridged. There are constant updates and patches that must be made to keep the software current and safe.</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Management:</strong>  IT must manage the LMS — the Learning Management System. And make sure accounts are set up properly. Long passwords are truly a pain. One 2nd grade teacher told me that she allocates 15 minutes — of a 45 minute class — for her class to log into their iPads. Holy Toledo! 2nd graders pecking away at a 10 character — numerals, capitals, symbols, letters — password. Is that really necessary? </li>
<li><strong>Classroom Support:</strong> And, IT staff visit classrooms to address device or networking issues. More and more, IT is managing devices (computing devices, access points) remotely. In the "old days," districts had individuals who taught teachers how to use the various pieces of software. But with budget cuts, now such software training is IT’s responsibility. </li>
<li><strong>Administrative Services &amp; Support:</strong> When the principals or the superintendent ask for a report versus a teacher asking for a password reset — well, you can imagine what takes precedence.</li>
<li><strong>Equity: </strong>We heard this loud and clear: equity is an issue that IT staff feel is, at least partially, their responsibility. For example, how can Interact access at home be provided for the 20% of children who do not have Internet at home? Whose budget pays for the personal access points? Classroom assignments are increasingly assuming access to the Internet is available to the students — outside of the school. </li>
</ol>
