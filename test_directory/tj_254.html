<p>The <a href="https://fpf.org/" target="_blank">Future of Privacy Forum</a> (FPF) and the <a href="https://dataqualitycampaign.org/" target="_blank">Data Quality Campaign</a> (DQC) recently relaunched the <a href="https://ferpasherpa.org/" target="_blank">FERPA|Sherpa</a> online hub of education privacy resources.</p>
<p>The website, originally created in the spring of 2014, offers parents, educators, policymakers and others relevant information, messages, tools and best practices related to safeguarding student data. The <a href="http://www.pta.org/" target="_blank">National Parent Teacher Association</a> (PTA) will assist the FPF and DQC in delivering the resources to schools and families nationwide.</p>
<p>“Technology and the internet are powerful tools for teaching, learning and family-school communication. At the same time, it is imperative that students’ academic and personal information is protected,” said Laura Bay, National PTA president, in a news release. “It is a top priority of National NTA to safeguard children’s data and make certain that parents have appropriate notification and consent as to what and how data is collected and used.”</p>
