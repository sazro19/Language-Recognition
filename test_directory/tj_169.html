<p>The worldwide market in infrastructure and services for wide area  networks (WANs) will reach $8 billion in 2021, thanks in part to the embrace of  software-defined (SD) networks, according to a new report from <a href="https://www.idc.com/" target="_blank">International Data Corp.</a> (IDC).</p>
<p>"The emergence of SD-WAN over the last couple of years has  paralleled the deployment of hybrid WAN architectures that have leveraged  broadband, 4G/LTE and other technologies," according to a news release. "SD-WANs  leverage hybrid WANs, but incorporate a centralized, application-based policy  controller, analytics for application and network visibility and security, a  software overlay that abstracts underlying networks and an optional routing  capability that together provides intelligent path selection across WAN links."</p>
<p>An IDC survey found that bandwidth optimization (36 percent),  consistent application security (31 percent), integration with existing WANs  (28 percent) and improved automation and self-provisioning (28 percent) were  the most common reasons enterprises are considering SD-WAN adoptions.</p>

<p>Other key findings of the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other common reasons for considering WAN adoptions  included faster deployments, operational efficiency and reduced complexity for  IT staff;</li>
<li>Top use cases for software defined WANs included  the ability to simplify WAN infrastructure, the ability to use multiple WAN providers  and the ability to use broadband to too offload non-critical apps; and</li>
<li>Key components of SD-WAN networks include WAN  optimization, network and application security, integrated routing, application  visibility and application policy-based path selection.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Given the affinity towards leveraging broadband for enhanced  capacity across enterprise sites, in parallel with the proliferation of  cloud-based applications and services, the enterprise WAN is being rapidly  re-architected to cost-effectively deliver new, secure capabilities," said  Rohit Mehra, vice president for network infrastructure at IDC, in a prepared  statement. "Understanding and adapting current WAN network and security  solutions across the emerging connectivity and application landscape is going  to be a key ingredient for success as this market transforms in key geographies  and across the service and solution provider domains."</p>
