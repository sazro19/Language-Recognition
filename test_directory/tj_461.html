<p><a href="http://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a> unveiled its latest iPhone Wednesday, returning to the market after a year with a new version of its signature product. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-7/" target="_blank">iPhone 7 and 7 Plus</a> couldn’t come at a better time for the world’s tech behemoth, as sales have been slumping on its iPhone and other products since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Apple also announced the upcoming release of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-2/" target="_blank">Apple Watch Series 2</a>, which will use a new operating system, <a href="http://www.apple.com/watchos/" target="_blank">WatchOS3</a>, will be “swim-proof,” and will feature GPS.</p>
<p>Here are 11 new features that come with the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which will start shipping Sept. 16:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wireless earphones are coming, with no headphone jack on the phone. They can be charged with a Lightning port. An analog adapter will be included in every box for those still tied to the old, wired earbuds.  </li>
<li>Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/airpods/" target="_blank">AirPods</a> are coming in October. They will each contain a W1 chip and essentially be powered with Bluetooth technology. The sound is purported to be significantly better. Cost: $159.</li>
<li>The iPhone 7 will come in jet black, with a high gloss finish, and regular black with an anodized matte appearance. It will still come in gold, silver and rose gold, with integrated antennas.</li>
<li>The home button has been re-engineered. It’s force sensitive with a Taptic engine inside. Different pressures and number of taps elicit different functions.</li>
<li>Water and dust resistant, to an IP67 protection standard.</li>
<li>New camera system, with an optical image stabilizer. The lens will be wider, with greater aperture a new flash that creates 50 percent more light. The 7 Plus will have two 12 megapixel cameras with a zoom feature and telephoto lens that can multiply a faraway image by 10 times the size.</li>
<li>A new retina HD display that’s 25 percent brighter. The color gamut will be wider, providing richer, more vibrant colors.</li>
<li>Stereo speakers that can hit twice the volume of the 6S or 6S Plus.</li>
<li>Apple Pay is coming to Japan in late October.</li>
<li> A new generation chip called the A10 Fusion will be 40 percent faster than the A9 (in the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus). Two high-efficiency cores will operate at 1/5 the power of the older edition to prolong battery life. Apple CEO Tim Cook calls it the “longest battery life ever in an iPhone.”</li>
<li> The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will come with iOS 10, which will feature updates to Messages, a more advanced Siri, more applications of 3D touch and redesigned maps, Apple Music, news and a home app.</li>
