<p><a href="http://www.instructure.com/" target="_blank">Instructure</a> has updated its Canvas learning management system in an effort to add "digital  efficiency" and real-time analytics to in-person instruction.</p>
<p>Focused on  active learning to encourage a concept the company calls "'lossless learning,' the suite  uses on-the-fly feedback to help educators make the most of every interaction  with their students by recording comprehension and skills assessment in  face-to-face educational settings," according to an Instructure news  release.</p>
<p>The new tools  include MagicMarker, Canvas Polls, Learning Mastery for Students and Quiz Stats.</p>
<p>"MagicMarker is an iPad application that allows teachers  to track in real-time how students are performing and demonstrating their  learning in group settings," according to an Instructure news release. "MagicMarker  bases measurement on outcomes or standards by simply swiping a certain  direction to indicate if a student answered correctly or incorrectly. Teachers  who provide students with frequent opportunities to respond can log performance  with simple gestures."</p>

<p>The app automatically transfers data to the Canvas gradebook,  where instructors can see it broken down by student or outcome.</p>
<p>Canvas polls is an app designed to allow instructors to  integrate formative assessments or gauge comprehension without the use of  physical clickers. Available for both iOS and Android, the app allows teachers  to look at outcomes for individual students, groups or a whole class.</p>
<p>Learning  Mastery for Students is an upgrade to the Learning Mastery Gradebook that  allows students or their parents to "follow their academic progress, providing greater visibility  into their strengths and areas of improvement," according to a news  release.</p>
<p>Quiz Stats has been updated to provide charts and graphs in  an effort to help teachers improve the effectiveness of assessments. The tool  aims to help instructors find trends in responses to determine if individual  questions are ambiguous or otherwise misleading and identify which questions  actually differentiate between high-performing and low-performing students.</p>
<p>"Online learning trends like massive open online courses  (MOOCs) have dominated the public conversation around education in recent  years, overshadowing the tremendous potential for technology in the physical  classroom," said Jared Stein, vice president of research and education at  Instructure, in a prepared statement. "While face-to-face education is  still the primary mode of teaching in our digital age, it has been difficult  for educators to seamlessly assess and track learning when their attention  should be on interacting with their students. These new tools change that."</p>
<p>The new tools will be publicly available to current Canvas  users at no additional cost beginning June 25. More information about Canvas is available at <a href="http://www.instructure.com/" target="_blank">instructure.com</a>.</p>
