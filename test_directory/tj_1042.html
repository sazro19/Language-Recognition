<p>Education service providers <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/" target="_blank">Blackboard</a> and <a href="http://www.pearsonk12.com/" target="_blank">Pearson</a> have struck an agreement that aims to improve integration of their complementary platforms. The partnership, according to the companies, will focus on enhancing the accuracy and exchange of data between Blackboard's K-12 solutions and Pearson's <a href="http://www.powerschool.com/" target="_blank">PowerSchool</a> student information system.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blackboard.com/Markets/K-12/solutions/Communications/Bb-Connect.aspx" target="_blank">Blackboard Connect</a>, a mass notification system, will be the first Blackboard system to be integrated with PowerSchool. New features include the ability to push notifications from within PowerSchool as well as more options for sending automated notifications to parents. </p>
<p>The new partnership follows a number of requests from educators that use the companies' systems. "Danvers Public Schools uses both PowerSchool and Blackboard solutions and ends up having to manage several daily changes," said Lisa Zaia said, database manager for the Massachusetts district, in a prepared statement. "We are thrilled that Blackboard and Pearson have agreed to improve their product integration to provide better accuracy of our student and staff information."</p>
