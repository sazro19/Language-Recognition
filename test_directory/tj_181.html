<p>A recent  survey among members of the <a href="http://digitalpromise.org/initiative/league-of-innovative-schools/" target="_blank">League of Innovative Schools</a> found that while every  participating district had dedicated staff for managing data, their maturity in  data integration was all over the map. Only a third of respondents (33  percent), for example, report that more than half of their teaching and  learning tools are linked with their student information systems. That  represents a lot of data that won't ever find its way into the SIS. Almost  three-quarters (74 percent) said their districts use more than 26 education  technology or software products; 17 percent use more than  100.</p>
<p>The survey  was small — 40 CTOs, data administrators and others who work within League  schools or districts. The League is an initiative of <a href="http://digitalpromise.org/" target="_blank">Digital  Promise</a>, to bring  together a peer-selected network of education leaders who agree to team up with  ed tech companies, researchers and others to provide a test-bed for new  approaches in teaching and learning.</p>

<p>While  nearly nine in 10 respondents (88 percent) said that data interoperability was  a consideration in decision-making for new ed tech purchases, fewer than half  (41 percent) as many thought teachers would say the same. As one director of  technology and innovation pointed out, while the district or a school will only  provide "approved" software or tools, the rules don't prohibit  teachers from getting and using software outside of the approved list.</p>
<p>Six  priorities surfaced in the survey among district leaders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing  privacy and security of student data;</li>
<li>Promoting  learning;</li>
<li>Finding  ways to give more time back to teachers and administrators;</li>
<li>Improving  the quality of data;</li>
<li>Doing  better reporting of data; and</li>
<li>Staying  compliant with federal and state regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  biggest areas of trouble:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working  with companies that won't or can't integrate the data their programs produce  with an existing LMS or SIS;</li>
<li>Managing  multiple logons;</li>
<li>Ensuring  data privacy;</li>
<li>Having  to do multiple integrations to extract data from systems;</li>
<li>Handling  auto-population of roster data; and</li>
<li>Monitoring  apps and "freemium" programs that haven't been officially approved by  the district.</li>
</ul>
<p>To help  educators grapple with data-related challenges, survey sponsor <a href="https://www.msdf.org/" target="_blank">Michael  &amp; Susan Dell Foundation</a> has made a number of case studies for handling data interoperability available <a href="https://www.msdf.org/blog/tag/interoperability-series/" target="_blank">on the foundation website here</a>.</p>
<p>A summary  of the survey findings is available <a href="http://digitalpromise.org/2017/08/03/state-data-interoperability-public-education/" target="_blank">on the Digital Promise website here</a>.</p>
