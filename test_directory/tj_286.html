<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a> says it believes coding is an essential skill and wants to teach it to students as young as kindergarten. For the next phase of its <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/09/09/apple-launches-everyone-can-code-initiative-and-apple-teacher-program.aspx" target="_blank">Everyone Can Code initiative</a>, the company teamed up with STEM learning company <a href="https://www.tynker.com/" target="_blank">Tynker</a> to launch two full, free courses purpose-built for Apple’s programming language <a href="https://swift.org/" target="_blank">Swift</a>. </p>
<p>Tynker has helped more than 50 million kids around the world learn introductory coding skills through games and activities. The new courses, “Space Cadet” and “Dragon Spells,” are now  available on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tynker-learn-to-code-programming-made-easy/id805869467?mt=8" target="_blank">Tynker iPad app</a> and incorporated into the “<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewBook?id=1118578018&amp;mt=11&amp;v0=www-us-education-everyone-can-code-book-swift-playgrounds-teacher-guide" target="_blank">Swift Playgrounds: Learn to Code 1 &amp; 2</a>” guides available on iBooks. Both courses ask students to solve coding puzzles and complete projects that combine Tynker’s visual code blocks and the Swift programming language. The initial launch is in English, but the company said it will add Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French and German versions by June. </p>

<p><em>THE Journal </em>spoke to Tynker’s co-founder and CTO Srinivas Mandayam to find out more about how the courses are designed to help young learners foster foundational computer science concepts.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> How do the two courses fit into Apple’s Everyone Can Code initiative?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Srinivas Mandayam:</strong> As the next step in the Everyone Can Code program, Apple today announced two digital books that are complete curricula for elementary schools, allowing them to actually teach computational thinking skills and coding to kids. Tynker is featured as the coding solution in those digital books. Our partnership with Apple involves us providing the actual activities for kids to do for the entire elementary curriculum from K–5. </p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal: </em>Can you elaborate on how Tynker is integrated into these guidebooks? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Mandayam:</strong> We worked very closely with Apple on the courses. We helped them author some chapters and they had curriculum experts and a few teachers review the materials. If you look at those books, we have about 8-10 chapters per guide, with each one addressing some specific computing concept. For example, a whole chapter is devoted to “sequencing,” which covers everything on the topic. When it’s time to put the concepts into practice, students can do corresponding exercises in the Tynker app, which now has these courses, too. </p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> What are teachers and students going to like about these two new courses?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mandayam: </strong>One thing about Tynker is that we’ve been at this for about four, five years now and what we’ve found is that if you try to bore kids with technical concept names, like “abstraction” and “modeling” and “algebraic thinking,” they really don’t like those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Our puzzles are all game-based, so the whole approach we use to teach is there is a problem presented and kids have to navigate through the game — going through obstacles and avoiding aliens — to get there. As they’re doing those things, they’re learning coding concepts without even realizing it. </p>
