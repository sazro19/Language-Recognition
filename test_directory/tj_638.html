<p><a href="http://www.hughesnet.com/" target="_blank">Hughes Network Systems</a>, a provider
of broadband satellite solutions and services, has launched a new suite of
products for educational institutions, including high-speed satellite Internet
access, digital signage, distance learning and managed wireless networking.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hughesnet.com/satellite-internet" target="_blank">HughesNet Gen4
Satellite Broadband</a> can provide high speed Internet access to rural and
remote schools and districts that don't receive terrestrial broadband service.
The service is available anywhere in the continental United States, as well as
Alaska, Puerto Rice and Canada. It uses a satellite in geosynchronous orbit,
meaning it's always in the same location in the sky, so the school's satellite
dish doesn't have to switch satellites periodically. According to the company,
HughesNet Gen4 satellite broadband service can help districts "meet federally
mandated online testing requirements."</p>
<p><a href="http://business.hughes.com/enterprise/solutions/drive-sales/digital-signage" target="_blank">HughesON
MediaSignage</a> solutions are digital signs that can display dynamic video,
text and graphics. According to the company, "schools can mount screens
throughout their campuses, customizing and positioning timely information for
student, faculty, staff and visitor communications and training, as well as for
instant emergency communications."</p>
