<p><em>Under Lanoue's leadership, a high-poverty system has received  numerous state recognitions as a model technology district. A former principal  and teacher, Lanoue assumed leadership of the Clarke County School District in  2009, and, under his leadership, Clarke County was recognized by the state of  Georgia as being the leading large district in closing the achievement gap. For  his efforts, Lanoue was named one of the nation's top 50 educational innovators  in digital learning by Converge magazine and was named 2015 AASA National  Superintendent of the Year.</em></p>

<h3>My Top 3 Digital Learning Tools that Redefine Learning Environments</h3>
<p>
<strong>1) Progress-Monitoring Based on  Practice</strong> <br/>
I anticipate that new technology  tools and analytics will allow us to better assess student achievement using  practice rather than tests. We have worked for the last three years with  Triumph Learning to develop new tools where student growth is determined in the  student workspace, and where teachers can have immediate student performance  information in real time. <br/>
<strong>2)</strong> <strong>Tools that Allow Students to "Share Space"</strong> <br/>
We utilize Google Apps for  Education, which has tremendous potential in providing a platform for students  to share learning space. Using Google tools, students can collaborate, as wells  as share work for review and feedback with each other and with their teachers.  Technology can have a reputation as creating isolation, but in our district we  have seen the opposite. <br/>
<strong>3) Access to Information and  Resources </strong>  <br/>
Full access to resources and  information will help level the playing field for all students. Students and  teachers must have access to resources and communication streams that extend  beyond school buildings and bell schedules. We are working closely with  community partners to have increased connectivity at non-profits, community  centers and businesses so that our students have an abundance of sites to  access their education. </p>

<p><strong>THE Journal: What part has  technology played in your vision for the district?</strong><br/>
<strong>Philip D. Lanoue</strong>: Well, let me give you the big picture. Clark County is a district  of about 13,000 students, and for counties between 70,000 and 225,000, we are  the third-most impoverished in the country. We're about 84 percent free and  reduced lunch, and certainly 6-7 years ago we had some major performance  issues. But we started an aggressive tech initiative four years ago, in  collaboration with the State of Georgia, and offered to be a model technology  district looking at everything from furniture to changing instructional design.  We modeled 1:1 initiatives for about a year and a half, much of it sparked by the  fact that we were building new schools and wanted them to reflect a different  learning environment. This year, students are taking home devices in grades 3-10,  with accounts stored in the cloud. We're also a full Google platform, which is  pretty exciting. We've added short-arm interactive projectors that act like a  smart board, but untether our teachers and kids, which has created a lot of  flexible spaces. Our goal is totally change our instructional design. What's  most exciting for me is that we've taken a district with high poverty, closed  the technology gap and changed outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>THE Journal: How does technology  help to close the achievement gap?</strong><br/>
<strong>Lanoue</strong>: It's equalized access to information for kids. It's also  allowed them to collaborate differently. Our kids now use these tools to be  better stewards of their own education – they share with each other, develop  tools with each other. Technology has brought an incredible opportunity and  strength to collaboration among students, and I think that's contrary to what  some people think. It also allows our kids to not think of education and  learning as occurring only within the school walls. I think that's the big  culture shift, is that student learning is now 24/7. The level of engagement is  so different now. It's remarkable. When you come to our classrooms you can feel  learning occurring as soon as you walk through the door. </p>
