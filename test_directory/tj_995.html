<p><a href="http://www.sfps.info/" target="_blank">Santa Fe Public Schools</a> (SFPS) has
replaced the conventional copper-based local area network (LAN) at one
elementary school with a new fiber optic LAN and plans to upgrade six more
schools before the 2014-15 school year.</p>
<p>One of the school district's goals is to "ensure efficient and effective
systems, operations, state-of-the-art technology and infrastructure to support
instruction and student learning," according to information on SFPS's site. In
support of this goal, the district implemented a 1-to-1 initiative at
<a href="http://www.sfps.info/index.aspx?nid=1242" target="_blank">Ramirez Thomas Elementary
School</a> during the 2013-14 school year, along with a new fiber optic LAN that
delivers gigabit speeds to students and teachers. </p>
<p>According to Elias Bernardino, executive director of IT for SFPS, the fiber
optic LAN helped the district save money by eliminating the need for
telecommunications closets and reducing the requirements for electronics, power,
ventilation and air conditioning. "Optical LAN requires fewer electronics and
less cabling, compared with legacy copper-based LANs," said Bernardino in a
prepared statement. </p>

<p>SFPS chose a <a href="http://www.tellabs.com/solutions/opticallan/" target="_blank">Tellabs
Optical LAN</a>, consisting of the Tellabs 120 Mini Optical Network Terminal and
Tellabs 728 Optical Network Terminals. According to information from the
company, "Tellabs Optical LAN converges all of a building's wired and wireless
communications networks into one — handling Wi-Fi, data, voice, CATV, security,
building automation networks and more." The optical LAN also enables more
schools to be served from a single hub since fiber optic cable can carry signals
20 to 30 kilometers from the central hub compared to only 100 meters for copper
cable.</p>
<p>Following the successful implementation at Ramirez Thomas Elementary, the
district plans to roll out the fiber optic LAN technology to six more schools
before the next school year.</p>
<p>Santa Fe Public Schools is located in Santa Fe, NM and serves approximately
14,000 K-12 students in 35 schools.</p>
