Starting this summer, <a href="https://clever.com/" target="_blank">Clever</a>
will be providing <a href="https://go.clever.com/googleclassroomrostering" target="_blank">automated
rostering for Google Classroom</a>. Clever provides a single sign-in
portal, roster syncing and other services used by 65% of K–12
schools in the United States. It’s free for districts.</p>
<p>
According to Clever, usage of its service has nearly doubled in the
last year. And the number of students and educators using Google
Classroom has nearly quadrupled since the beginning of 2020, from 40
million to 150 million.</p>
<p>
With the new integration, districts using <a href="https://edu.google.com/products/workspace-for-education/education-plus/" target="_blank">Google
Workspace for Education Plus</a> will be able to sync classes in
Google Classroom. According to Clever: “Districts who have
purchased Google Workspace for Education Plus and use Clever will be
able to sync rosters directly to Google Classroom from any Student
Information System. Once a school technology administrator sets up
Google Classroom via Clever, teachers will no longer need to manually
create and invite students to join their classes, saving teachers
time and enabling them to focus on what they do best: helping
students reach their full potential.”</p>

"Educators have overcome incredible obstacles this past year to
support student learning," said Tyler Bosmeny, chief executive
officer of Clever, in a prepared statement. "Through this new
partnership with Google Classroom, we're proud to be removing one of
those obstacles: making sure every teacher's digital classroom will
be fully set up and ready for learning on the first day of school."</p>
<p>
“Setting up classes has often been a manual, time-consuming
distraction for teachers,” said Shantanu Sinha, lead for Google for
Education, also in a prepared statement. “This new partnership will
simplify workflows and empower educators to focus on what they do
best: helping students reach their full potential.”</p>
<p>
Clever and Google indicated that the new integrated functionality
will be available in time for back to school and that there will be a
beta for summer school. Further details, including a signup for
updates and for the summer beta program, can be found at
