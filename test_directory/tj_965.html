<p>Apple and Samsung accounted for a full 71 percent of tablets shipped in the first quarter of 2014. Apple remained in the top spot for the quarter, though Android as a whole accounted for slightly more than half of all new tablets shipped through March, according to early results released by market research firm <a href="https://www.abiresearch.com" target="_blank">ABI Research</a>.</p>
<p>Of the top 3 vendors, only No. 2 Samsung showed positive growth in the quarter, which is typically the softest quarter for tablet sales. Samsung shipped 13 million units, up 10.8 percent from the same quarter in 2013.</p>
<p>"Despite questions remaining about data disclosure in 2010 and 2011, Samsung's release of tablet sales data this past quarter is a good sign for the mobile computing market," said ABI Senior Practice Director Jeff Orr in a statement released to coincide wit the report. "Whether due to its confidence in the economy, its own business, or a combination of reasons, Samsung continues to demonstrate tablet growth as its 2013 retail push in North America and Western Europe pays off."</p>

<p>No. 1 Apple shipped 16.4 million units, down 10.1 percent from the same period last year.</p>
<p>ASUS rounded out the top 3 with 2.1 million units shipped, essentially flat compared with last year at -0.8 percent.</p>
<p>All told, 41.3 million  tablets shipped in the first quarter of 2014.</p>
<p>In terms of operating systems, Google's Android held 56.3 percent of the overall market; Apple's iOS held 39.6 percent; and Microsoft's Windows 8 and Windows RT accounted for 4.1 percent of the tablet market. (As previously reported, <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2014/05/20/surface-pro-3-gets-12-inch-screen-upgraded-processors.aspx">Microsoft is launching a new 12-inch Windows 8 tablet</a> in the second quarter of this year.) ABI noted that the OS results may fluctuate by up to 3 percent as more vendors report their numbers.</p>
<p>Also worth noting: A full 22 percent of tablets shipped in the first quarter included an integrated 3G/4G model — "the highest penetration seen since the September quarter of 2011," according to ABI.</p>
