<p>Proximity-based mobile interactions are moving out of the realm of science fiction and into the education, healthcare and retail markets. WiFi provider <a href="http://www.aerohive.com/" target="_blank">Aerohive Networks</a> is partnering with <a href="http://radiusnetworks.com" target="_blank">Radius Networks</a>, a company specializing in proximity services and proximity beacons with iBeacon and AltBeacon technology, to create a cloud-managed WiFi infrastructure that can deliver personalized messages based on a user's location. </p>
<p>iBeacon (for iOS devices) and AltBeacon (an open specification developed by Radius Networks) are transmitter technologies that enable a smartphone or other device to perform actions in the context of a specific location. For instance, a shopper's phone could receive a notification when nearby items are on sale.</p>
<p>"Organizations are looking for new technologies to enable them to use real-time data to better engage with their end users and drive relevance so they can offer better services and customized experiences," said Bill Hoppin, vice president of business development for Aerohive Networks, in a press release. "Proximity beacons with iBeacon and AltBeacon technology are a key part of Aerohive's strategy to do just that. Our partnership with Radius Networks has allowed us to deliver the world's first integrated enterprise WiFi iBeacon-enabled solution tailored for retailers, but also providing unique capability for schools and healthcare providers."</p>
