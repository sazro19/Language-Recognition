<p>Information security professionals  are 10 percent less likely to report that their organization was the victim of  a phishing attack in 2016 than in 2015, though that still means three-quarters  of organizations were targeted and half of that same group said phishing  attacks are on the rise, according to the latest <a href="https://info.wombatsecurity.com/state-of-the-phish" target="_blank">State of the Phish</a> report from <a href="https://www.wombatsecurity.com/" target="_blank">Wombat Security  Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>The report found a 64  percent increase in the number of organizations measuring the risk posed by end  users. The company also reported that it had examined more simulated  phishing e-mails than in the previous year and found that click rates  are improving for many industries and for organizations with mature programs.</p>
<p>"Our survey of the general public  revealed that more people are aware of the concept of phishing than most of us  probably thought," according to the report. "However, these same  people struggled to identify what ransomware is. These end users also showed  that they put their organizations at risk by doing things like checking  personal e-mail on their work devices. Overall, this survey points to the fact  that there is work to be done to teach people how to stay safe."</p>

<p>The report is based on "tens of millions of simulated phishing  e-mails sent over a 12-month period," according to information released by  Wombat, plus more than 500 survey responses from security professionals around the world representing more than 16 industries, as well as a survey of more than  1,000 end users worldwide.</p>
