<p>Innovating in education, especially with technology, doesn't  come without its hurdles. These may be organizational; they may involve people not  knowing what to do or having a lack of resources, but the result is a slow-down  in the adoption of innovation. The top one, however, is growing the innovation  once it has been proven, <a href="https://cosn.org/driving-k-12-innovation-2019-hurdles" target="_blank">according to a new  report</a>.</p>
<p>The report was produced by the <a href="https://cosn.org/" target="_blank">Consortium for School Networking (CoSN)</a>,  which has taken over the work from the New Media Consortium's Horizon K-12  reports, a decade-long series that ended in 2017 when that organization ceased  operations. CoSN participated in that series as a lead partner, and now it has  picked up the baton with the goal of producing three shorter and more focused  reports each year for the K-12 segment.</p>

<p>According to an international advisory board of 111  education technology experts assembled by CoSN, the top five hurdles to  innovation for K-12 (from a list of 27) were these:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sustaining  and scaling innovation,</em> expanding new practices "from a few classrooms  to multiple settings across schools and school systems"; this was  specified by 44 percent of the advisory board members;</li>
<li><em>Digital  equity</em> (cited by 43 percent), gaining access to the "broadband  connectivity, digital tools and content and innovative instructional  strategies" for every student in every school;</li>
<li><em>Filling  the gap between pedagogy and technology</em> (42 percent), with a  "continual, dialectical relationship between research and pedagogy"  and "timely professional development for teachers";</li>
<li><em>Providing  ongoing professional development</em> (35 percent), which needs to be  "personalized" and "job-embedded" for greatest impact; and</li>
<li><em>Figuring  out technology and the future of work</em> (32 percent) and sorting out how  learning and teaching need to adapt in a world of "artificial  intelligence, robotics and deep learning," which are expected to have a  major effect on work for students.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report offered a bunch of advice from the members of the  advisory board, such as, "Encourage professional learning  communities" and "monitor the effectiveness of technology and make  course corrections, if needed." But perhaps the best advice was to begin  conversations with the school community to get its help in overcoming the  hurdles and turning them into "opportunities."</p>
<p>"Technology is changing at breakneck speed -- and the  pace is accelerating," wrote Keith Krueger, CEO of CoSN, in a statement.  "Building on the important work of the 'Horizon Report,' the Driving K-12  Innovation series will help education leaders keep up with the digital  ecosystem so they can improve learning settings and opportunities for all  children. This entails tackling the major hurdles that are discouraging  innovation."</p>
<p>Over the next year, the organization will also release two  additional reports, "Accelerators," covering "megatrends"  that drive change; and "Tech Enablers," on tools that help manage the  change. CoSN also said it would release a toolkit in 2019 to help school  leaders and practitioners with the conversations they need to have to put their  plans into action.</p>
<p>The "Hurdles" report is available with  registration <a href="https://cosn.org/driving-k-12-innovation-2019-hurdles" target="_blank">through the CoSN  website</a>.</p>
<p>While CoSN is a vendor-neutral professional association for  school district technology leaders, the "Driving K-12 Innovation"  project is being supported by a number of companies, including <a href="https://www.classlink.com/" target="_blank">ClassLink</a>, <a href="https://edu.google.com/k-12-solutions/?modal_active=none" target="_blank">Google</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>, <a href="https://education.emc.com/content/emc/en-us/home.html" target="_blank">Dell EMC</a>, <a href="https://www.kajeet.net/" target="_blank">Kajeet</a> and <a href="https://www.ena.com/" target="_blank">Education Networks  of America</a>.</p>
