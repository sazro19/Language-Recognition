<p><a href="http://www.blackboard.com/" target="_blank">Blackboard</a> and <a href="http://authenticasolutions.com/" target="_blank">Authentica Solutions</a>, a company that  provides tools for data authentication and management, have extended a  partnership that aims to improve the bi-directional flow of data between  Blackboard's learning management systems and other education applications.</p>
<p>As a result of the expanded partnership, Blackboard users  will now have access to Authentica's <a href="http://authenticasolutions.com/centrifuge" target="_blank">Centrifuge</a>, which offers a  centralized data store designed to combine multiple elements into a single data  stream using the CEDS format. "Combined with <a href="http://authenticasolutions.com/datasense" target="_blank">DataSense</a>," according  to a news release, "Centrifuge enables schools to better integrate data  management elements and timelines, delivering the combined data in formats  defined by the schools, such as analytical reports and state reporting."</p>
<p>"Blackboard provides incredible learning solutions for  millions of students around the world and we are excited to be a part of their  growth," said Russell Long, Authentica Solutions CEO, in a prepared  statement. "While we continue to grow Blackboard's DataSense data  integration solutions across districts, we are also offering higher education  solutions surrounding enterprise level data integration needs across their  complex software solutions. Our increased support of Blackboard's Moodlerooms  customers is also growing quickly providing the latest in bidirectional data  integration across software platforms."</p>
