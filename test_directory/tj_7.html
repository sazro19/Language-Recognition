<p><a href="https://kahoot.com/" target="_blank">Kahoot!</a> has formally completed its acquisition of <a href="https://clever.com/" target="_blank">Clever</a>.
The companies earlier this month announced they had received the
necessary regulatory approval to move forward.</p>
<p>Kahoot! is the maker of the popular education apps used at home
and in formal education environments.
</p>
<p><a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2021/09/09/ed-tech-use-accelerates-beyond-the-peak-of-the-pandemic.aspx">In
a recent report, Kahoot! was found to be the seventh most frequently
used digital tool in K–12 education for the 2020–2021 school
year</a>. It was beaten only by Google, which took the top six spots.</p>
<p>Clever provides a single sign-in portal, roster syncing and other
services used by more than 89,000 individual schools in the United
States — representing about 65% of K–12 school districts and half
of all U.S. preK–12 students. <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2021/09/09/ed-tech-use-accelerates-beyond-the-peak-of-the-pandemic.aspx">In
the same recent report</a>, Clever was found to be the 12th most
frequently used digital tool in K–12 education, behind various
digital tools from Google (1–6, 8 and 10), Kahoot! (7), Zoom (9)
and Wikipedia (11).</p>

<p>Clever’s single sign-on portal has been free for districts from
the start. Clever makes its money through agreements with application
developers who use its services. Clever has 600 such developer
agreements in place, including a <a href="https://thejournal.1105cms01.com/articles/2021/04/29/google-classroom-getting-integration-with-clever.aspx">recent
deal with Google</a>, as well as companies like Zoom, McGraw Hill and
Khan Academy. Those partnerships gave Clever revenues of $44 million
in 2020.</p>
<p><a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2021/05/06/kahoot-acquiring-clever.aspx" target="_blank">The
transaction, announced in May</a>, was valued at up to $500 million. It was completed Sept. 2.</p>
