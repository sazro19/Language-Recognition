<p><a href="https://www.peopleadmin.com/" target="_blank">PeopleAdmin</a>, a talent management software company for K–12 and higher ed, and visual analytics company <a href="https://www.tableau.com/" target="_blank">Tableau</a> have combined forces to develop enterprise-level analytics for K–12 talent management.</p>
<p>Tableau's analytics — which <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/3611117/magic-quadrant-business-intelligence-analytics" target="_blank">Gartner rated highly for innovating business intelligence</a> — will be integrated into PeopleAdmin’s <a href="http://www.talentedk12.com/" target="_blank">TalentEd</a> solution, which helps school districts automate and streamline  talent management functions related to employee recruitment, hiring, position management, onboarding, recordkeeping and performance management, according to information from the company. </p>
<p>For starters, TalentEd is connected to <a href="https://www.schoolspring.com/" target="_blank">SchoolSpring</a>, one of the largest K–12 education-specific job boards with more than 800,00 unique visitors per month and 70,000-plus available job openings. District leaders can utilize the <a href="http://www.talentedk12.com/epi/" target="_blank">Teacher EPI assessment tool</a> to identify best-fit candidates from the job board. Once they are found, TalentEd takes the candidate through the rest of the onboarding processes. </p>
