<p>In the last few months, there has been no shortage of new  data surrounding education. Like the Twitter and news cycle, it's hard to keep  up and make sense of what statistics matter most to help address the needs of  districts today.  </p>
<p>When it comes to advancing 21st-century learning settings,  I'm going to catch you up and give you the statistics that you need to know. </p>
<p>Earlier this spring, CoSN unveiled the new findings from our  <a href="https://cosn.org/focus-areas/leadership-vision/it-leadership-survey" target="_blank">2018 National K-12 IT Leadership Survey Report</a>. Conducted in partnership with  Dude Solutions and MDR, the annual survey provides the education community with  insights from school system technology leaders on their challenges and  priorities. </p>
<p>This year's report found that school leaders place a high  priority on cybersecurity and broadband/network capacity. When asked to rate  the importance of privacy and security of student data, 68 percent of IT  leaders indicated that it was more important than the prior year. For the  fourth straight year, budget constraints are the top challenge facing school  technology leaders, followed by the unavailability of relevant training and  professional development, as well as the existence of silos in school  districts. </p>

<p>In addition, integrating technology into the classroom  continues to be the most understaffed IT function in schools — it has remained  the most understaffed IT function for three straight years by a significant  margin. And 43 percent of respondents said that their staffs are "stretched too  thin."</p>
<p>Another national report that requires your attention came  from the U.S. Department of Education in the spring. The national study on "Student  Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom," which was  mandated by Congress, identified significant gaps in home broadband access  among K-12 students. More important, it addressed what is commonly known as the  "homework gap." </p>
<p>The report found that there is a significant difference  between the percentage of all U.S. households with internet access (77 percent)  and the percentage of households with students ages 3 to 18 with internet  access (61 percent). The two main reasons children ages 3 to 18 lacked access  to the internet at home were expenses and lack of interest. The study also  showed that 80 percent of 8th graders reported using a computer at home for  schoolwork on a weekday, putting students without home internet access at a  significant disadvantage. </p>
<p>Geographic locale also plays an important role in home-based  internet access. Students in remote rural and distant rural areas generally  have more limited internet access than students in suburbs, cities or towns.  The academic impact of these disparities is significant. The report found that  students without home internet access had lower assessment scores in reading,  mathematics and science across a range of national and international  assessments. International comparisons against advanced countries showed that  the United States had a higher-than-average percentage of 16 to 19 year olds  with the lowest level of computer literacy skills.</p>
<p>The study makes clear that additional research is needed to  assess how technology is being used for education purposes outside of school.  It also underscores the critical role of the E-rate program in ensuring  equality of internet access in American schools, as well as the importance of Lifeline  modernization, which includes broadband as a support service for low-income  families.</p>
<p>While internet and connectivity gains are being made  nationwide, it's clear that schools and students are still at a big  disadvantage. Many school systems lack the funding and professional resources  to modernize their learning environments. And many students lack access to the  connectivity needed to complete assigned homework and make use of the  increasing educational resources and tools available online. </p>
<p>In the 21st century, this should not be the case. Providing  all schools and students equitable learning environments and opportunities is a  civil rights issue. The new data further highlights this national priority and  the need for continued action by our local and federal leaders. </p>
