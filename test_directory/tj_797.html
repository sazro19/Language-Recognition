<p>The <a href="http://www.dentonisd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1" target="_blank">Denton Independent  School District</a> has deployed a free mobile app in an effort to improve  student participation.</p>
<p>The app, <a href="http://versoapp.com/#verso" target="_blank">Verso</a>,  works on any device and allows teachers to create challenges for students.  Students come up with their own responses and can see the responses of their  classmates, anonymously, after submitting them.</p>
<p>"It's safe to say that at least 20 or 30 percent of the  students who will participate with Verso wouldn't otherwise do so," said Kevin  Zahner, a history teacher who piloted the app at Denton High School last  spring, in a news release. "With an environment that is anonymous, the  more reserved students are now willing to take a risk and put themselves on the  line both from an intellectual and emotional standpoint, and let their  classmates evaluate their responses without knowing who said it."</p>
<p>Mike Mattingly, assistant superintendent of  curriculum &amp; instruction for the district, said the app may be  useful in confronting issues such as bullying, as well. "We can get a lot  of true feelings out there on the table since the students can respond in a  safe, independent manner, and not just mimic what someone else has said,"  Mattingly said in a prepared statement. "We can start making headway and  know better how to deal with the issues at hand."</p>
