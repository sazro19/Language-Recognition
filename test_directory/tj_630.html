<p><a href="http://www.ptsteams.com/index.php" target="_blank">Prologic Technology Systems</a> has launched mobility tools for its
<a href="http://www.ptsteams.com/products.php" target="_blank">Teams</a> enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform to provide administrators
and teachers access to real-time student and teacher data via mobile devices.</p>
<p>"Teams mobility functionality offers principals improved staff oversight with the ability to view attendance not posted, unfilled
substitute jobs and retrieve a particular student's record showing attendance, schedule, report cards, discipline and parent/guardian contact
information," according to a news release. "Teams mobility also means faster response times to discipline incidents. Both principals and
teachers can easily enter incident information into the system from their mobile device and quickly begin the district's referral process —
whether they are in school hallways, classrooms or the lunchroom."</p>
<p>Compatible with iOS, Android and browsers such as Chrome and Safari, Teams mobility tools uses data encryption while information is in
transit and does not store data locally.</p>

<p>"Mobile access to TEAMS student information system is part of our overall mobile strategy — to deliver tools that are genuinely capable of
enhancing productivity and collaboration — while at the same time, simplifying future systems so that they can jump from desktop to tablets to
smart phones easily," said Jeff Pepper, president of Prologic Technology Systems, in a prepared statement. "We see mobility as a key strength
going forward as we continue to press the envelope when it comes to technology solutions that just don't meet, but exceed district
expectations."</p>
