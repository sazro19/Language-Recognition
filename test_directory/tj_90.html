<p>Before <a href="https://www.carmelunified.org/">Carmel Unified School District</a> began its software defined networking journey, Network Administrator Rob Perry spent a lot of time putting out fires. He would get constant complaints of outages. Students would open their Chromebooks in the classroom, and, depending on the site, "half of them" wouldn't be able to connect to the network. Or in kindergarten rooms at one of the elementaries, any time more than one person tried to get on the network, operations "would grind to a halt."</p>
<p>Perry has been in network management for more than two dozen years, and when he joined the California district in 2016 it didn't take him long to figure out that the state of the network was "very patchwork." Some parts were in "really good shape" and others "looked like they hadn't had much attention."</p>

<p>Some of that was budgetary. There were only two central IT people besides him: the chief technology officer and a data specialist. Another three site technical support assistants were spread across eight sites. And there was far more work to be done than anyone had time to handle. At the same time, the schools were deep into their digital transformations. Grades 3 through 12 were already 1-to-1, and other network demands were really beginning to heat up.</p>
<p>An infusion of new IT hires and reorganizing of the existing tech team lessened the pressures on staff (which is now up to 11 people). Perry was able to employ a systems specialist to take over some of his duties, including server and phone system management. That freed him up to start focusing on the infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Picking the Low-hanging Fruit</h3>
<p>As he began digging in, he found a lot of "really old equipment" and "aged" wiring. For example, when he started running tests at that kindergarten, he found users were sharing a 50 kilobit/second link, in spite of the fact that they were on fiber. Not only was the connection spliced with different types of fiber, but the switch that it was going to wasn't configured properly.</p>
<p>So, Perry's first major effort was to get the wiring upgraded. The district paid for the systems specialist to get certified as a fiber installer, and he went into the schools and pulled "many hundreds of feet of new fiber" as part of the project.</p>
<p>Next up, getting the switches upgraded and putting schools in the position of being able to exploit the 10-gigabit backbone that was already in place.</p>
<p>Those changes in themselves made a difference "of night and day" for users, said Perry.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it was no big deal when a rival team was playing at the high school stadium, drawing record crowds, and everybody wanted to post pictures, videos and comments to Facebook or Twitter; or when people making interactive presentations in the high school theater would ask the audience to pull out their phones and get on the guest network to fill out a Google form or give online responses. Teachers didn't have to worry about how well their new virtual reality labs, robotics classes or makerspaces would hold up under the network demands.</p>
<p>Then the work was helped along by the hiring of a new superintendent, Barb Dill-Varga, in mid-2017, who put tech at the top of the to-do list. In late 2017 Perry began work on a proposal that Dill-Varga called "<a href="https://www.carmelunified.org/site/handlers/filedownload.ashx?moduleinstanceid=6491&amp;dataid=17589&amp;FileName=Ed%20Committee%20Meeting%20-%20FULL%20PACKET.pdf">Project 2020</a>," a two-and-a-half-year plan to update the entire network infrastructure for "a modern educational environment." But the superintendent informed him that his timeframe was too long. She wanted it done faster. "She was a huge source of support in making sure we had the funding we needed and accelerating our timeline," Perry noted.</p>
