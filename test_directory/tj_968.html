<p><a href="http://www.invincea.com/" target="_blank">Invincea</a> has released
<a href="http://www.invincea.com/research-edition" target="_blank">Invincea Research Edition</a>, 
a malware discovery and analysis solution for the data forensics and incident 
response (DF/IR) community, which the company is offering for free to DF/IR 
professionals.</p>
<p>Invincea Research Edition includes licenses of
<a href="http://www.invincea.com/get-protected/enterprise-edition/" target="_blank">Invincea 
FreeSpace</a>, access to CrowdSource and integration with
<a href="http://www.threatgrid.com/" target="_blank">ThreatGRID</a>. According to the company, 
FreeSpace "creates a secure virtual container around Web browsers and their 
plug-ins" and provides behavioral-based malware detection; CrowdSource is a 
command line tool for malware analysis; and ThreatGRID is a unified malware 
analysis and threat intelligence solution designed to help organizations defend 
against advanced cyber attacks.</p>
<p>DF/IR teams can use FreeSpace to investigate potential watering hole attacks 
or discover drive-by download sites by visiting those URLs, and they can analyze 
suspicious email links by opening those documents. When FreeSpace detects an 
exploit, it sends related forensic information "to a cloud-hosted instance of
<a href="http://www.invincea.com/get-protected/invincea-management-server/" target="_blank">
Invincea Management Service</a> (IMS) where threat intelligence is crowdsourced" 
and DF/IR teams can analyze findings, such as details on command and control, 
timelines of attach, registry changes and dropped files.</p>

<p>According to the company, CrowdSource is "a command line tool for rapid and 
scalable malware analysis" and requires no experience in malware analysis. It 
predicts the capabilities of a malware executable by using Web-sourced 
annotations of code and machine learning.</p>
<p>One-click integration with ThreatGRID is designed to help users "chart the 
origins of the thwarted attack; conduct advanced search, pivoting and 
correlation with any and all analyzed artifacts against the entire ThreatGRID 
database; and understand past uses of identified command and control 
infrastructure."</p>
<p>Further information about Invincea Research Edition can be found on the 
company's site.</p>
