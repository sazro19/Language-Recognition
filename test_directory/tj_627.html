<p>The
<a href="https://www.syracusediocese.org/" target="_blank">Roman
Catholic Diocese of Syracuse</a>, NY, has
incorporated a new student
information system (SIS) throughout all
22 of its schools after experimenting with it last year at four.</p>
<p>After
evaluating its existing SIS in 2013, <a href="http://setoncchs.com/" target="_blank">Seton
Catholic Central High School</a> found it lacking in a number of ways. The
previous
system couldn't schedule classes with multiple sections nor handle
unscheduled
course requests. Problems with inaccurate grade point average
calculations
forced school staff to prepare all report cards manually.</p>
<p>As
a consequence, the diocese tried <a href="https://www.rediker.com/" target="_blank">Rediker Software's</a> SIS
at Seton and four feeder elementary schools. After being satisfied with
its
performance during the 2014-15 school year, the diocese made the
decision to
use it in all four of its middle/high schools and 18 elementary schools.</p>
<p>Diocese representatives said the new system now allows
it to quickly create reports and analyze data across all of its
schools, and
even makes it easier to transfer students from one school to another.</p>

<p>"Rediker's
software tackles the toughest issues,
whether it be creating a master schedule with an abundance of
singletons and
part-time shared teachers or creating student schedules individually,
by grade
or all at once," said Seton Catholic High School Vice Principal Anchen
Schulz.</p>
