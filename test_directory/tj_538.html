<p>The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), America's new  education law, isn't the only proponent of state control over K-12 educational  activities. A new report by the <a href="http://www.setda.org/" target="_blank">State Education  Technology Directors Association</a> (SETDA) and <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/kids-action" target="_blank">Common Sense Kids Action</a> advocates that states play a bigger role in increasing access to high-speed  connectivity for students and teachers. And that's essential, the report  stated, for "creating and delivering the deeper learning experiences  intended to prepare today's students for college and careers, and to compete in  a global economy."</p>
<p>"<a href="http://www.setda.org/priorities/equity-of-access/statek12broadbandleadership/" target="_blank">State  K-12 Broadband Leadership: Driving Connectivity and Access</a>" lays out  the importance of broadband policies, networks and funding at the state level  for delivering high-speed and Wi-Fi access for all students, not just in  schools, but also in communities and homes. The report provides examples of  states that have shown leadership in a number of areas: K-12 broadband and  Wi-Fi connectivity; infrastructure, broadband implementation and advocacy for federal  support of broadband.</p>

<p>The report quotes from the Federal Communications Commission's <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2016/db0129/FCC-16-6A1.pdf" target="_blank">2016  Broadband Progress Report</a>, which stated that more than four in 10 schools (41  percent) still haven't met the FCC's short-term goal (based on earlier SETDA  guidance) that delivers at least 100 Mbps per 1,000 users, and few schools have  met the long-term goal of 1 Gbps/1,000 users for connectivity capable of  supporting digital learning applications. The FCC also found that out-of-school  access continues to be elusive; 10 percent of Americans lack access to speeds  of at least 25 Mbps for downloads and 3 Mbps for uploads and nearly 40 percent  of people in rural areas and tribal lands lack access to adequate broadband.</p>
<p>One pocket of on-going progress profiled is New Mexico,  where Governor Susana Martinez introduced a "Broadband for Education"  initiative last October that calls for delivering 1 Mbps/student by 2018.  Currently, that work is focused on aggregating E-rate Category 2 buying of  Wi-Fi and networking equipment in school districts and libraries. Alabama has  offered a "mini-quote" system to New Mexico, which, as the report  described, "functions like 'EBay in reverse,'", whereby companies  openly compete on price in response to district requests against a statewide  master contract. The state estimates that the approach could save schools $3  million in a single E-rate cycle. Also, multiple state agencies are  coordinating with non-profits to leverage E-rate funding.</p>
<p>Although states play a significant role in directly building  up education-grade broadband, the report noted, they can also perform a "pivotal  role" in pushing for federal policies and funding to support digital  learning too. SETDA cited its members' contributions to the 2014 E-rate  modernization process as evidence. Their work included participation in focus  groups, meetings with FCC staff members and submission of public comments for  rulemaking. SETDA members also pushed for increased funding, a streamlining of  the E-rate application process and additional flexibility for spending — most  of which showed up in the final E-rate modernization regulations.</p>
<p>"Something is wrong when coffee shops have faster  Internet connections than most of our schools," said James Steyer, CEO and  Founder of Common Sense, in a prepared statement. "Policymakers in state  capitals and in Washington, D.C. are facing the fact that critical funding is  necessary to support the continued adoption of technology in classrooms  throughout the country. With the use of advances in technology for learning and  for administration, we must do everything we can now to finish the job of  connecting every classroom and library."</p>
<p>SETDA said that later this spring it would release another  report with updated recommendations for minimum broadband capacity targets compared  to those in its 2012 "<a href="http://www.setda.org/priorities/equity-of-access/the-broadband-imperative/" target="_blank">Broadband  Imperative</a>" report and the network design necessary to achieve these  targets. It will also offer guidance on addressing home Internet access and  community partnerships.</p>
