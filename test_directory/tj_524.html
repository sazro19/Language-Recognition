<p dir="ltr">Worldwide tablet shipments slumped 14.7 percent during the first quarter of 2016, according to preliminary data released today by <a href="http://www.idc.com">International Data Corp. (IDC)</a>, a market research firm. First-quarter seasonality, along with an overall unenthused customer base, were factors that caused the decline, IDC reported. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Shipments of Apple tablets, including iPad and iPad Pro, dropped 18.8 percent in the first quarter of 2016, compared to the first quarter of 2015. Apple’s tablet market share also slipped from 27.2 percent in Q1 2015 to 25.9 percent in Q1 2016. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, detachable tablets — devices that include removable keyboards — saw triple-digit year-over-year growth on shipments of more than 4.9 million units, an all-time high for the first quarter of a calendar year. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“With the PC industry in decline, the detachable market stands to benefit as consumers and enterprises seek to replace their aging PCs with detachables,” said Jitesh Ubrani, senior research analyst with<a href="http://www.idc.com/tracker/showproductinfo.jsp?prod_id=81"> IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers</a>, in a prepared statement. “Apple’s recent foray into this segment has garnered them an impressive lead in the short term, although continued long-term success may prove challenging as a higher entry price point staves off consumers, and iOS has yet to prove its enterprise-readiness, leaving plenty of room for Microsoft and their hardware partners to reestablish themselves.” </p>

<p dir="ltr">The first quarter of 2016 also witnessed the introduction of detachable tablets from traditional “mobile-first” vendors such as Samsung and Huawei. The mid-range pricing for these new units will make them a challenging sell, as consumers desiring performance will likely go for a Microsoft Surface-like device, and the budget minded lean toward more affordable products from vendors such as EFun, RCA and others. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“The introduction of detachables from traditional smartphone vendors is only beginning and pose a real threat to traditional PC manufacturers,” said Jean Phillippe Bouchard, research director, Tablets at IDC, in a prepared statement. “Their understanding of the mobile ecosystem and the volume achieved on their smartphone product lines will allow them to aggressively compete for this new computing segment.” </p>
<p dir="ltr">Though slate tablets, like the iPad or Samsung’s Galaxy Tab, continued their decline, they still accounted for 87.6 percent of all shipments, IDC reported. Nonetheless, the slate tablet segment has become synonymous with the low-end of the market. This may be good news for vendors like Amazon that depend on hardware sales to increase their ecosystem size; however, it has not aided vendors who rely solely on greater margins for hardware sales. </p>
