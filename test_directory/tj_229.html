<p><a href="https://www.dudesolutions.com/" target="_blank">SchoolDude</a> by Dude Solutions today expanded its portfolio of a cloud-based operations management tools with the introduction of Help Desk, an IT help desk management platform for K–12 and higher education institutions. The announcement was made at the <a href="https://conference.iste.org/" target="_blank">ISTE (International Society for Technology in Education) conference</a> in San Antonio, TX.</p>
<p>Help Desk is designed to improve communication between faculty/staff and IT support teams, streamline work order management and improve asset tracking. Users can submit support requests via e-mail or through a request submission portal, and the IT tickets are automatically routed to technicians based on their locations or skill sets. Users then receive automated e-mail updates as tasks are started and resolved.</p>
<p>On the IT side, the platform's data reporting tools provide configurable reports and interactive dashboards to help analyze productivity and improve decision-making. Help Desk also integrates directly with SchoolDude's TechnologyEssentials Insight and Mobile Device Management products, helping provide IT managers with an overall view of the organization's IT and mobile assets.</p>

<p>"As school IT teams are typically understaffed and have limited resources, Help Desk can reduce requests and streamline workflows to get issues resolved quicker and maximize the IT support team's efficiency," said Nick Mirisis, vice president of marketing for Dude Solutions, in a statement. "With a data-centric approach to tracking requests, labor and cost trends, our support team can help IT leaders use data and reporting tools to make the best long-term decisions for their organization."</p>
