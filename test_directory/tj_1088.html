<p><a href="http://www.vernier.com/" target="_blank">Vernier</a> has introduced <a href="http://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/temperature-sensors/gw-temp/" target="_blank">Go Wireless Temp</a>, a wireless sensor that records temperature data when connected to an iOS device. The instrument enables to users to study temperature in the environment as well as in systems such as fish tanks, greenhouses, thermal mugs and heating and cooling devices.</p>
<p>Go Wireless Temp works like a thermometer and is supported by a free iOS app. Students can use the app to collect temperature readings with their iPads, iPhones or iPod Touch devices. The instrument also supports Graphical Analysis for iPad, an app that enables students to "save data, perform curve fits, annotate graphs, perform statistical calculations and export data for additional analysis," according to Vernier.</p>
<p>Additional information about Vernier's wireless sensors is available at the company's <a href="http://www.vernier.com/" target="_blank">Web site</a>.</p>
