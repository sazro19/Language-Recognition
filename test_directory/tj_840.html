<p>Researchers from <a href="http://www.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell University</a>, 
the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a>  
and <a href="http://www.umass.edu/" target="_blank">University of Massachusetts</a> have 
proposed an application to help network operators find the best routes for their 
data and bypass Internet traffic jams.</p>
<p>The IN-CONTROL (Programmable Inter-Domain Observation and Control) 
application will gather information from participating networks and store it in 
a database that network operators can query to find the best routes, bypassing 
faults and untrustworthy networks. The researchers said they think network operators 
will support the proposal because it will result in improved network 
performance.</p>
<p>While previously proposed "knowledge planes" have required extensive upgrades 
to network hardware, this one will rely instead on tools already available in 
modern programmable Internet routers. The application will build on ideas from a 
programming language developed by Nate Foster, assistant professor of computer 
science at Cornell, "that allows network programmers to write commands for what 
they want routers and other devices to do without having to understand the 
details of the hardware," according to a news release from Cornell.</p>

<p>Because some network operators may be reluctant to share details about how 
their systems are organized, IN-CONTROL will include security mechanisms to hide 
the detailed architecture of participating networks and to prevent the addition 
of false information intended to redirect traffic for the purpose of spying. 
According to Cornell, "the preliminary database will be assembled using the 
system’s own probes that gather basic information about forwarding paths."</p>
<p>The IN-CONTROL project is funded by a $3 million grant from the
<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/" target="_blank">National Science Foundation</a>.</p>
