<p>Two Chicago area districts are introducing teachers and  students to iOS coding in order to expand a focus on programming. <a href="http://www.barrington220.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1" target="_blank">Barrington 220  School District</a> and <a href="http://www.d214.org/" target="_blank">High School District 214</a> are working with the <a href="http://schools.mobilemakers.co/" target="_blank">Mobile Makers  Academy</a>, which is offering professional development for teachers as well as  curriculum for students and support for the classes.</p>
<p>According to a company statement, about 500 students in  seven schools will be the first to try out the new high school coding program, which  formally launched this fall.</p>
<p>The student program covers 130 hours of in-class teacher-led  coding instruction. The education will address programming of mobile apps,  development of user interfaces, managing code in a team and agile project management.  By the end of the school year, participants are expected to have built  "several" mobile apps and learned about variables, branching and  conditionals, storyboards, arrays and dictionaries, navigation controllers, app  deployment and other topics.</p>

<p>"Introducing students to mobile software development  early on brings relevance to the classroom and ensures our students are  competitive in higher education and the workplace," said Lazaro Lopez,  associate superintendent of High School District 214, which has six  participating schools. But one "significant challenge," he added, was  finding teachers with experience in coding to teach the subject.</p>
<p>To prepare the educators, nine of the teachers went through  training to learn Swift, Apple's programming language, as well as the iOS  software development kit and agile methodologies. By the end of the training,  they had created a gradebook app.</p>
<p>Mobile Makers also developed the curriculum that will be  used in the high schools' classes and said it provides dedicated support in  person and online. The curriculum includes readings, screencasts, quizzes,  instructor slides and challenges for topics in each subject area. During the  classes, the teacher acts as the client.</p>
<p>"It's exciting that the district has embraced this new  opportunity for students to learn coding. They look forward to learning Apple's  new programming language. I hope this leaves them wanting more in our four-year  sequence of computer science class offerings," said Kristen Fisher, an <a href="http://eghs.d214.org/" target="_blank">Elk Grove High School</a> computer science teacher  who completed the training. "Our students are learning how to be creative,  solve complex problems and use critical thinking through a technical framework.  We are creating a tangible way to expand STEM education."</p>
