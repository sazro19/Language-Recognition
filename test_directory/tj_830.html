<p><a href="http://www.remote-learner.net/" target="_blank">Remote-Learner</a>, a
<a href="https://moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle</a> partner that provides Moodle services 
and support, has released a fully supported, Microsoft Azure-certified Moodle 
service through the
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/remotelearner/fully-supported-moodle-version27/" target="_blank">
Azure Marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform that lets organizations deploy 
and manage software as a service. According to Jason Cole, CEO of 
Remote-Learner, while "many organizations have discovered the advantages of 
running Moodle on cloud services instead of their own technology 
infrastructure," they have been lacking maintenance and support, on-demand 
training and custom configurations. Remote-Learner developed its Microsoft 
Azure-based Moodle services and support to provide educational institutions with 
the advantages of the cloud along with maintenance, support, training and 
configuration.</p>
<p>Remote-Learner's service for Moodle 2.7 on Microsoft Azure will include:</p>

<li>Preconfigured and maintained enterprise-level configuration of Moodle 
	2.7;</li>
<li>Access to a support portal;</li>
<li>More than 40 approved third-party addons; and</li>
<li>Access to the Remote-Learner's Learning Spaces on-demand training 
	program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remote-Learner plans to make new major point versions of Moodle available 
through Microsoft Azure 90 days after the public release. Remote-Learner uses 
the 90-day window "to test the 40 addons, make sure the module maintainers have 
a chance to update their releases and get the first round of patches from the 
core team," according to a spokesperson from the company. Even as it introduces 
support for new versions of Moodle, Remote-Learner will continue to support 
Moodle 2.7 as long as Moodle does.</p>
<p>Remote-Learner developed the Microsoft Azure-based Moodle service in 
partnership with Nivel Siete, a Latin American Moodle partner with technical 
expertise in external cloud deployments, and Nivel Siete will also provide 
support and maintenance services for Latin American organizations.</p>
