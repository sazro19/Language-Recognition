<p>We live in an era of Big Data and small devices. The combination of mobile computing and always-connected, cloud-based software creates enormous freedom for students and teachers — and enormous headaches for the technology officers tasked with managing it all. In an <a href="http://www.iesdinc.com/edroomoverview.html" target="_blank">EdRoom</a> roundtable co-hosted by <em>THE Journal</em> and <a href="http://www.cosn.org/" target="_blank">CoSN</a>, district-level tech leaders shared their concerns and offered some solutions to colleagues looking to make sure that private data stays private. </p>
<p><strong> When it comes to privacy of student data, what are the issues that K-12 educators need to be concerned with?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Steve Young</strong>: Privacy and confidentiality of data is a paramount issue, in and outside of K-12 education. Malicious and nonmalicious use of personal data can range from disturbing to outright criminal. We have seen Facebook use personal users' photos in advertising, and we have seen massive data breaches like the theft of identity information of over 110 million Target customers.</p>
<p> As districts, we are required to protect student data under the federal <a href="http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html" target="_blank">FERPA</a> guidelines. But guidelines or not, we owe our students the right to privacy of their confidential information. What scares me as an IT administrator is that major multinational companies with large IT staffs and IT security specialists are experiencing breaches daily. Very few of us in K-12 education are lucky enough to even have a dedicated IT security staffer. That seems to make the challenge we face almost insurmountable. But this does not mean we should ignore our duties to our students. We need to be diligent in securing systems, educating our staff and students and selecting technologies and systems that are secure.</p>
<p>Selecting technologies raises what I see to be a larger issue. Every district staff member to some extent is now an IT staffer. Anyone can sign up for free, cloud-based Web software and potentially be sharing private student data in a matter of minutes, entirely bypassing an IT department or any approval process. A teacher might unknowingly sign up his students on a Web platform that does not comply with <a href="http://www.coppa.org/comply.htm" target="_blank">COPPA</a>, with the best of intentions of trying something new out with his students. Or an office worker may mistakenly place a spreadsheet of FERPA-protected data into an online file-sharing service like <a href="https://drive.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> or <a href="https://www.box.com/" target="_blank">Box</a> and mistakenly share this data with persons not approved to access it. All of this only takes a few clicks and can be done by virtually anyone in any school.</p>
<p>One of the main ways to combat this is through education of staff. Districts need to leverage online training, newsletters and other opportunities to educate staff about the importance of protecting students and their data. </p>

<p><strong>Jean Tower</strong>: Security of student data is more important than simply having a student database system that is secure. There are many ways information can leak out. Educators need guidelines that help them operationalize the sometimes vague ideas of privacy that many teachers have. For example, COPPA is a driver behind many Web 2.0 sites' terms of service requirement that users must be 13 or older to create an account. Yet many educators think it is okay to have elementary school students sign up for <a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a> or <a href="http://instagram.com/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>  or some other app that has great educational potential. </p>
<p>K-12 education needs to be concerned about data privacy and security at many levels, from the district level and enterprise software all the way down to the classroom level and apps that teachers are making uninformed decisions about using. </p>
<p>We need helpful tools that can guide district leaders through the process, helping them to pay attention to data issues and suggesting actual language to include in service contracts.  </p>

<p><strong>Curt Cearly</strong>: We in the technology department and many others at the district level know about FERPA, <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/" target="_blank">HIPAA</a>, COPPA, <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act" target="_blank">CIPA</a> and the rest of the alphabet soup that guides our decisions at the enterprise level and drives our discussions with vendors, suppliers and others to ensure the greatest level of protection possible. </p>
<p>Easy guidelines, repeated warnings, training and education, and constant vigilance are necessary to protect students and their data at the enterprise level, the classroom level  and the student/parent level. We provide our schools this <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/mail.fcboe.org/document/d/1A1uS_8IeahNG4Hkx9OK0-23YTmDQNz-S8P-WSyDb5Kk/edit" target="_blank">table</a> of some of the most frequently used applications with a review of their terms of service, age limits and parental permission requirements. We review it quarterly (about all we really have time for, which isn't a great solution) and update or add information for teachers and staff.</p>
<p>Being mindful guardians of the data entrusted to us (teachers, administrators, staff) is an imperative. Selecting enterprise solutions that help us be protective of that data is an essential first step. Digital citizenship and an awareness of the "footprint" we (teachers, students, staff, parents) create is an imperative. Teaching and training all who work with students, parents, faculty and staff is an essential first step in that imperative.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Tebbenkamp</strong>: In addition to those mentioned above, a consideration that districts continue to struggle with educating staff on is adhering to policy when it comes to protecting the student information and refraining from unapproved online resources. </p>
<p>We have guidelines and policy in place that explicitly state that all student information should be kept private and secure, including encrypting information that may be on a mobile device or online storage. However, we still risk incidents each year where a laptop is stolen or USB drive lost that has FERPA-protected information that is not encrypted. Student information is stored on online file-sharing. I have found that the best approach in our district has been a "hit the pavement" approach where administrators personally connect with teachers and educate them on the "why we shouldn't/can't" and let the word spread from there.</p>
<p>Another major concern we have been facing are sites that explicitly state that by signing students up for accounts, the teacher/district is taking on the responsibility of compliance with COPPA. Educating our teachers about privacy policies and terms of service is imperative. The documents are long, and nobody wants to take the time to read all the legal jargon. However, it is important to understand the terms for each resource used. It is also difficult to keep a current, comprehensive list of approved/unapproved resources. Therefore, we must trust our teachers to make wise decisions about their chosen resources and provide them with the education and resources to help them make the best decision. </p>

<p><strong>Lenny Schad</strong>: I will add a couple things: 1) We need consistency in the legal opinions regarding COPPA and FERPA as they relate to the K-12 space. The application of each act is different with each attorney, and therefore different within each district. Adherence to these acts is critical and should not be invented by each individual school system. If we could get a consistent opinion for each act, application and adherence would be a lot easier. 2) One of the areas I am most concerened with regarding data security is second-party data mining. There is not a school system in the country that does not have sensitive data in the cloud. How can we ensure that our data being stored in the cloud is not being mined by second parties, and if it is, what data is being mined and where is it going?</p>
