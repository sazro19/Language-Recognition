<p>The <a href="https://passk12.org/" target="_blank">Partner  Alliance for Safer Schools (PASS)</a> has released an updated edition of  its safety and security guidelines for K-12 schools. The fourth edition of this  publication has updated the guidelines to fit within a simplified structure of  multiple tiers and layers, added best practices for districts, expanded  coverage of policies and procedures and covered new topics, including school  transportation systems, cybersecurity and network infrastructure and  architecture.</p>
<p>The purpose of the report is to supply anybody who's  interested with guidance for implementing "a layered and tiered approach to  securing and enhancing the safety of school environments." PASS, founded  in 2014, consists of a group of education, law enforcement and industry people  who work together to develop information and tools that will enhance school  safety.</p>
<p>Most of the guidelines focus on physical security and  "life safety" and avoid specific product recommendations. They also  don't reach beyond policy or technology considerations into the realms of  mental health, behavioral threat assessment, deployment of public safety  personnel or rules on firearms.</p>

<p>The layered approach recommended by the organization is  intended to set up successive obstacles that will "deter, detect or delay  adversarial behaviors." The five layers begin at the district, move onto  the property perimeter, the parking lot, the building and, finally, the  classroom.</p>
<p>As an example, the most comprehensive approach for securing  the "interior perimeter"  —  those classrooms  —  the guide explained,  was to include these technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>A public address system;</li>
<li>The addition of E-911 to the phone system;</li>
<li>A two-way intercom system with call buttons;</li>
<li>A duress button system for offices and  classrooms;</li>
<li>And in-building emergency communication system;</li>
<li>A distributed antenna system;</li>
<li>Mass notification tied to a district-wide  system;</li>
<li>Building-wide communication via outside calls;  and</li>
<li>Use of mobile applications and social media.</li>
</ul>
<p>The more of these there are, the greater the level of  security.</p>
<p>The report offered a roadmap for formulating a security  management plan, which begins with assembly of a team, consisting of a security  director (if one exists), a school administrator, a security integrator or  consultant, an IT director and representatives from local first responder  agencies. Then it's onto tackling risk assessment, to understand the risks  associated with each building on campus, and includes development of a plan and  budget for improving the security. From there, the team is charged with  creating a building assessment that uses a PASS-developed checklist to address  the best practices. Then it's time to create a "detailed document"  for the plan, which includes budget.</p>
<p>"The safety and security challenges schools face today are  more multifaceted and complex than ever before, and protecting students and staff  requires a comprehensive approach to these challenges," said Guy Grace, PASS  chairman and director of security and emergency planning for <a href="https://littletonpublicschools.net/" target="_blank">Littleton Public  Schools</a>, in a statement. "We are proud to build on the PASS guidelines,  which present the most comprehensive information available on best practices for  securing school facilities, an essential component supporting all-hazards approaches  to school safety."</p>
<p>The guidelines are available with registration <a href="https://passk12.org/guidelines-resources/pass-school-security-guidelines/" target="_blank">through  the PASS website</a>. The same registration gives access to the  "school safety and security checklist" as well.</p>
