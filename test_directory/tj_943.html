<p> Mobile may once have been proscribed tech on American  K-12 campuses, but it now enjoys a "substantial presence in most school districts." According to a new report published by ed tech firm <a href="http://www.iesdinc.com/" target="_blank">IESD</a>, more than two-thirds of school districts in the United States have mobile technologies deployed in a significant number of their classrooms.</p>
<p>The report, "<a href="http://www.stemreports.com/" target="_blank">2014 National Survey on Mobile Technology for K-12 Education</a>," surveyed more than 300 school district leaders to gauge their attitudes toward mobile technology and examine how mobile tech is being used in instruction. The report — the third annual edition — was produced by IESD in collaboration with <a href="http://www.stemreports.com/" target="_blank">STEM Market Impact</a> and <a href="http://mchdata.com/" target="_blank">MCH Strategic Data</a>.</p>
<p>According to the report, 70.8 percent of district leaders said that mobile tech has been adopted in at least a quarter of their schools, with another 9.8 percent saying adoption is likely to happen in the next couple years.</p>

<p>Among adopters, about one-fifth  said their districts have 1-to-1 deployments in place. The biggest barrier to 1-to-1 adoption is funding, as, according to the report, "most districts are interested [in adopting 1-to-1 or expanding their 1-to-1 programs] if they could afford it."</p>
<p>Other findings from the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is strong interest among districts in purchasing both tablets and Chromebooks;</li>
<li>Districts leaders see mobile tech as a means of increasing student achievement and making "learning more engaging and personalized";</li>
<li>Personalized instruction was also seen as a benefit to mobile;</li>
<li>The most beneficial mobile apps cited by district leaders were textbooks, collaboration tools and "creation tools"; and</li>
<li>Benefits cited by survey participants included "uses of mobile technology as a tool for completing assignments; as a tool for online instruction and for whole-group instruction; as a platform for course communication; as a way for students to demonstrate learning and/or share their work with the class; and as a student collaboration tool," according to the report.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from funding, the biggest challenges cited by district leaders were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teacher professional development and support; </li>
<li>Mobile device management;</li>
<li>Bandwidth limitations and lack of networking infrastructure, including inadequate WiFi; and</li>
<li>Device damage and repair.</li>
</ul>
