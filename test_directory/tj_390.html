<p>The GS408EPP's  design allows for two switches to be mounted in a single 1U rack slot.</p>
</div>
<p>Network  device maker <a href="http://www.netgear.com/" target="_blank">NetGear</a> has introduced two switches intended to help administrators  support power over Ethernet (PoE+)  devices in challenging locations. The new line uses a "Virtually  Anywhere" mounting system that enables the switches to be installed  vertically, horizontally, against a flat surface or in perpendicular placement.</p>
<p>The  mounting design support the proliferation of wireless devices within an  enterprise, such as wireless access points, surveillance  cameras and security door locks, that depend on PoE to keep them operational.  The new eight-port switches can be attached to a wall, under a desk, strapped  to pole or placed in the ceiling near a ventilation duct.</p>
