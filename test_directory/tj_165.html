<p><a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/home.jsp" target="_blank">Gartner</a> has  released its list of top 10 strategic technology trends for 2018 with a focus  for the coming year on technologies related to artificial intelligence and  machine learning and those that blend the physical and digital worlds.</p>
<p>"Gartner defines a strategic technology trend as one with  substantial disruptive potential that is beginning to break out of an emerging  state into broader impact and use, or which are rapidly growing trends with a  high degree of volatility reaching tipping points over the next five years,"  according to a news release.</p>

<p>Gartner's first trend for next year is AI Foundation. The company  predicts that the development of systems that learn and adapt and even function  autonomously will remain a major battleground through 2020 at least.</p>
<p>"AI techniques are evolving rapidly and organizations will need to  invest significantly in skills, processes and tools to successfully exploit  these techniques and build AI-enhanced systems," said David Cearley, vice  president and Gartner fellow, in a prepared statement. "Investment areas  can include data preparation, integration, algorithm and training methodology  selection, and model creation. Multiple constituencies including data  scientists, developers and business process owners will need to work together."</p>
<p>Nearly every app and service will incorporate some level of AI in the  next few years, according to the company, making intelligent apps and analytics  the second trend to watch in the coming year. Whether they're obviously  intelligent or use intelligence behind the scenes, these tools "create a  new intelligent intermediary layer between people and systems and have the  potential to transform the nature of work and the structure of the workplace,"  according to Gartner.</p>
<p>"Explore intelligent apps as a way of augmenting human activity and  not simply as a way of replacing people," said Cearley in a prepared  statement. "Augmented analytics is a particularly strategic growing area  which uses machine learning to automate data preparation, insight discovery and  insight sharing for a broad range of business users, operational workers and  citizen data scientists."</p>
<p>Intelligent things, Gartner's third trend, rounds out the trends related  to AI and machine learning. These tools, comprising everything from autonomous  vehicles to connected industrial and consumer systems, are physical objects  that incorporate AI to better interact with their surroundings or people.</p>
<p>Fourth on the company's list, digital twins are virtual representations  of real-world objects or systems. Digital twins are linked to their real-world  counterparts and useful for understanding them, responding to changes or  otherwise improving operations or value.</p>
<p>"Over time, digital representations of virtually every aspect of  our world will be connected dynamically with their real-world counterpart and  with one another and infused with AI-based capabilities to enable advanced  simulation, operation and analysis," said Cearley in a news release. "City  planners, digital marketers, healthcare professionals and industrial planners  will all benefit from this long-term shift to the integrated digital twin  world."</p>
<p>The company's fifth trend, cloud to the edge, comprises a pair of  technologies that some see as competing.</p>
