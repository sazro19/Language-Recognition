<p>IBM has added OpenStack services to its
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/" target="_blank">IBM Cloud</a> marketplace to 
support interoperability between on-premise IT systems and off-premise cloud 
workloads. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank">OpenStack</a> is a free and open source 
cloud computing software platform for public and private clouds. With the 
addition of OpenStack services to the IBM Cloud marketplace, it will be easier 
for IT teams to deploy an OpenStack cloud on top of IBM Cloud. The service 
provides access to <a href="http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/iaas.html" target="_blank">
SoftLayer's</a> self-service global cloud infrastructure, giving organizations 
the "flexibility, security, power and scale of IBM cloud in an open 
environment," according to the company.</p>
<p>As educational institutions increasingly shift operations to the cloud, many 
are choosing open standards, such as OpenStack, which provide them with more 
flexibility than proprietary standards. According to  the company, 
IBM OpenStack services will give organizations that flexibility, letting them 
"select from a range of underlying hardware configuration options based on open 
standards and deploy services from IBM’s SoftLayer global data centers with a 
managed-services approach based on the needs of the workload."</p>

<p>The company cited a number of benefits of using its OpenStack services, 
including faster deployments and improved consistency across multiple 
environments owing to improved interoperability between hosted and on-premise 
systems, as well as predictable performance, speed and agility.</p>
<p>In related news, IBM introduced object storage as a service on its open cloud 
development platform, <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/bluemix/" target="_blank">Bluemix</a>. 
Developers can use Bluemix to create applications and store their objects in 
SoftLayer's OpenStack Swift-based Object Storage. According to the company, 
Object Storage is more scalable than traditional file system storage 
environments, requires less metadata to store and access files, and reduces the 
overhead of managing file metadata, so organizations can scale out object 
storage "simply by adding nodes."</p>
