<a href="http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/555/flexible-computing/dvs-enterprise-windows-server-2012" target="_blank">
Dell Wyse Datacenter for Microsoft VDI and vWorkspace</a> combines some of the 
company's existing data center infrastructure solutions into "a single, 
end-to-end Hyper-V based desktop virtualization solution." It's designed to help 
organizations create a centrally hosted virtualized environment, so end users 
can access data and applications as if they were running locally. It supports 
most endpoint operating systems including iOS and Android, so it is suitable for 
bring-your-own-device (BYOD) environments. Meanwhile, the single management 
console is designed to simplify application and system support and security for 
IT staff.</p>
