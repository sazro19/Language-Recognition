<p><a href="http://www.fcboe.org/" target="_blank">Fayette County Schools</a> in Georgia will 
provide its economically disadvantaged students with free wireless Internet 
service at home in an effort to close the district's digital divide.</p>
<p>Fayette County has a bring-your-own-device policy, but some students 
can't afford to buy their own devices. The district already works with 
Title I parent liaisons in its elementary and middle schools to identify 
qualifying families and loan them equipment. Now those families will also 
receive filtered mobile broadband service to ensure students can access 
educational resources from home.</p>
<p>“The pen and paper days are gone in school, but when kids needed paper and 
pencil, we provided the materials,” said Clarice Howard, Title I Coordinator for 
Fayette County Schools, in a prepared statement. “Today all students need access 
to computing devices. Through Title I funds, our district provided devices for 
those who couldn’t afford them, and, with the need to extend the learning day, 
it’s our responsibility to level the playing field for these children by 
providing equipment for connectivity after school.” </p>

<p>The district has partnered with the wireless service provider Kajeet to give 
Title I students a <a href="http://www.kajeet.com/4u/education/Smartspot.html" target="_blank">
Kajeet SmartSpot</a> for accessing online textbooks, apps, e-mail, documents, 
sites and their teachers when they are outside of school. The SmartSpot is a portable mobile hotspot that works with the Kajeet Sentinel cloud portal 
to filter student connectivity. Districts and schools can block access to 
specific sites and disable the service during specific time periods to help 
keep students focused on educational content and reduce costs. The Kajeet 
service also provides teachers and administrators with learning analytics 
reports to help them monitor student progress.</p>
<p>Kajeet has also partnered with the Consortium for School Networking (CoSN) 
and the National Title I Association to produce a toolkit for districts, 
“Rethinking Educational Equity in a Digital Era: Forging a Strong Partnership 
between District Title I and Technology Leaders,” which is available through
<a href="http://info.kajeet.com/rethinking-educational-equity-in-a-digital-era" target="_blank">
Kajeet's site</a>.</p>
