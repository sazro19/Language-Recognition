<p>Even as education spending is expected to inch up two  percent this year to reach $67.8 billion worldwide, the way in which school  districts, colleges and universities are spending that money is evolving to reflect  the growing digital nature of teaching and learning, according to <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/home.jsp" target="_blank">Gartner</a>. In a new report,  "<a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/2926323" target="_blank">Top 10 Strategic  Technologies Impacting Education in 2015</a>," the business IT consulting  firm ranked 10 innovations and tech trends that it believes the education CIO  should plan for in 2015.</p>
<p>Many of the technologies aren't emerging from within  education itself, said Gartner Vice President Jan-Martin Lowendahl. They're  being "driven by major forces such as digital business and the  consumerization and industrialization of IT."</p>
<p><strong>1. Adaptive Learning</strong><br/>
Coming in at first place is a technology that has been  around in some form for six decades, the firm reported. Now, however, the  ability to "capture learner data through online learning" has given adaptive  learning new life in schools as a road to personalizing instruction. As Gartner  noted, "The real value of adaptive learning lies in the metadata attached  to each learning 'morsel,' which must then be combined with enough empirical  data of students trying to master the topic to allow personalized learning."</p>

<p>Why does Gartner put it at the top of the list? "Adaptive  learning seems to be maturing fast, but has not yet hit the 'Trough of  Disillusionment.' A lot of real-world testing remains, but the potential  rewards are enormous," the report declared.</p>
<p><strong>2. Adaptive Digital Textbooks</strong><br/>
The idea behind this type of e-textbook is to track how  students interact with the text and then adapt the content appropriately  through assembly and disassembly, the inclusion of material from other sources  and the addition of social interaction with others using the content.</p>
<p><strong>3. CRM</strong><br/>
Constituent relationship management (CRM) has long been part  of the vernacular at least in higher education to stay on top of relationships  with potential, current and former students; families; companies; benefactors  and other members of the institutional community. However, said Gartner, institutions  are struggling to standardize and integrate their other institutional data with  this data for better decision making.</p>
<p><strong>4. Big Data</strong><br/>
The big data "exhaust" generated by the numerous  digital activities of students, parents, instructors and staff is moving beyond  the realm of district and institutional research and reporting and into the larger  domain of school operations. The application, Gartner suggested, "has the  possibility to improve the whole education ecosystem."</p>
<p><strong>5. and 6. Sourcing  Strategies and 'Exostructure'</strong><br/>
The first of these refers to the accumulation of technologies  and vendor services that provide software, hardware and services that are "required  to fulfill an enterprise's business objectives." Strategic sourcing encourages  IT to job out the work that's utility-based to steer the focus of its internal  resources "toward activities that enable differentiation and innovation."</p>
<p>Along the same lines, exostructure is Gartner's term for  building out a school's education ecosystem with external partnerships, tools  and services rather than building up strength in those areas internally. As the  analyst firm explained, "The future belongs to exostructure rather than to  infrastructure."</p>
<p><strong>7. Open 'Microcredentials'</strong><br/>
Although badges and points — microcredentials — have been  gaining steam among some educational initiatives, what they lack has been  openness. Open microcredentials is a move to shift away from proprietary  versions of badges and to open initiatives. This technology strikes Gartner as  one that requires a "relatively small investment...with good ROI."</p>
