<p><a href="https://www.versa-networks.com/" target="_blank">Versa Networks</a> and <a href="https://www.mode.net/sd-wan/" target="_blank">Mode</a> are teaming up in an effort to improve software-defined WAN and SD-CORE integration.</p>
<p>SD-WAN brings software-defined networking (SDN) benefits such as agility, programmability and the decoupling of hardware from its control software to  WANs, while SD-CORE is a newer take on evolving core network technologies, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), with SDN. 
</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based Mode emerged out of stealth four months ago with a plan to improve upon MPLS, which it said was reliable but expensive, difficult to manage and not agile. Mode said its new approach to provide autonomous enterprise cloud private networks  maintained that MPLS reliability and performance while improving flexibility, at a lower cost.
</p>
<p>"Mode's software-defined core network (SD-CORE) supports organizations as they move to the cloud by working with last-mile internet and SD-WAN to deliver end-to-end connectivity with the reliability and QoS of MPLS, the flexibility of a cloud service, and the cost of business Internet," the companies said in a statement. "SD-WAN with SD-CORE enhances site-to-site, SaaS/IaaS/UCaaS, and remote cloud access."

<p>Now, in the new partnership announced this week, Mode is putting its technology to work to provide more flexibility, reliability and visibility to Versa's Secure SD-WAN, extended through the WAN core. 
</p>
<p>Calling the partnership an evolution of SD-WAN/SD-CORE integration, Versa marketing exec Atchison Frazer said, "Our partnership with Mode is a natural progression in software-defining and transforming private networks away from inflexible legacy and hardware-driven WANs. The synergy of a cloud-native WAN edge and software-defined core enabled rapid integration between Versa Secure SD-WAN and Mode SD-CORE. We welcome offering a joint, cloud-native, software-defined private connectivity solution to augment legacy global WAN infrastructures for our Secure SD-WAN customers."
