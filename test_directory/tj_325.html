<p>“ClassFlow’s mission is to improve education by working with teachers, schools and students to create modern classrooms,” said Vin Riera, CEO of <a href="https://www.prometheanworld.com/" target="_blank">Promethean</a>, the owner and operator of ClassFlow, in a statement. “By giving teachers access to the latest tools and resources, students will be able to interact with lessons in new ways that will motivate them to learn.”<br/>
<br/>
Through its newly expanded roster of next-generation digital content partnerships, ClassFlow now provides teachers with an even broader array of immersive, interactive resources and tools for integrating STEM-based learning practices across a variety of subjects. Here are some details of the partnerships:</p>
<p>Gooru is a nonprofit organization building technology to help students navigate learning. ClassFlow’s partnership with Gooru will give teachers an avenue to discover open content designed for future-ready learning. Through an integration, teachers will have access to quality resources that guide student-centric learning experiences.</p>
<p>SketchFab is an online community that publishes and shares 3D content online and in virtual reality (VR). With a community of more than half a million content contributors, SketchFab is one of the world’s largest platforms for 3D content online, including subjects such as science, nature, cultural heritage and more.</p>
<p>PhET Interactive Simulations is a project from the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu" target="_blank">University of Colorado Boulder</a>. By engaging students in exploration and discovery, the simulations provide an interactive experience that taps into students’ curiosity and helps students understand key ideas. PhET Interactive Simulations has delivered more than 360 million simulations since its inception, and has been translated in more than 80 different languages.</p>
<p>Desmos aims to help every student love math. <a href="https://www.desmos.com/" target="_blank">The company's free tools</a> allow students to easily connect, visualize and grasp concepts more easily. Its digital calculators can be used during math lessons and include basic, scientific and graphing calculators. In addition, more than 100 graphs are available on the ClassFlow Marketplace. Desmos’ software is compliant with the <a href="https://www.desmos.com/accessibility" target="_blank">WCAG 2.0 accessibility standard</a>, allowing students with visual disabilities to participate fully.</p>
<p>“In 2014, I began implementing ClassFlow to optimize activities, such as delivering lessons and exercises, taking notes and asking questions,” said Valerie Camille Jones, mathematics specialist and recipient of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching at Atlanta’s <a href="http://www.ronclarkacademy.com/" target="_blank">The Ron Clark Academy</a>, in a statement. “Since then, ClassFlow has increased student participation in my class, and I have been able to get a better sense of how students were making sense of what was being taught.” </p>
<p>ClassFlow has more than 3 million registered accounts and is used in over 125,000 schools and institutions in 150 countries. For more information, visit <a href="https://classflow.com/" target="_blank">ClassFlow’s website</a>.</p>
