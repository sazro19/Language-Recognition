<p>A telecom and business communications company has released a new set of services intended to provide schools and districts with access to
wireless technology. <a href="http://www.adtran.com/" target="_blank">ADTRAN</a> announced <a href="http://www.adtran.com/web/url/procloud.edu" target="_blank">ProCloud.Edu</a>, which includes cloud-managed infrastructure for the
wired and wireless network as well as centralized, browser-based network management, content filtering, classroom device control functionality
and capacity planning help. The announcement comes just days after the company said it was making a big play for education networking business
through state procurement deals.</p>
<p>The purpose of ProCloud.EDU, according to ADTRAN, is to help schools set up their 1-to-1 programs without "burdening" IT departments with
the work of managing new infrastructure. Schools can also customize the deployment with added implementation services and help desk support.</p>
<p>"Anticipated E-rate funding for Wi-Fi, along with a burgeoning number of education applications is driving classroom wireless adoption,"
said Nolan Greene, research analyst for <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P7159" target="_blank">IDC's Network
Infrastructure Group</a>. "New solutions are needed to plan and deploy secure classroom Wi-Fi while also addressing policy controls and
ongoing maintenance in a lower-touch way in order to support the best learning environment possible."</p>

<p>At the end of March the company kicked off a national program for schools, districts and education consortiums, which are pursuing funding
to build out their networks under the newly revamped E-rate program.</p>
<p>"Schools today are facing increasingly complex demands when it comes to ensuring consistent, adequate and secure wireless access," said
Michelle Southerland, ProServices product manager. "The ADTRAN ProCloud.EDU solution brings together a hardware and software suite to provide a
world-class, secure Wi-Fi network that facilitates a new vision for mobile learning. Educators will now have the modern technological tools
needed to maximize both teacher and student achievement."</p>
<p>Among ADTRAN's school customers are <a href="http://www.pittsfield.net/" target="_blank">Pittsfield Public Schools</a> (MA),
<a href="http://www.aubreyisd.net/site/default.aspx?PageID=1" target="_blank">Aubrey Independent School District</a> (TX) and
