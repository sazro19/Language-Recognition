<p>North Carolina's <a href="http://www.person.k12.nc.us/" target="_blank">Person  County School district</a> has adopted an online registration tool in an effort  to streamline enrollment for the families of 4,700 students.</p>
<p>The district chose <a href="http://www.powerschool.com/powerschool-registration/" target="_blank">PowerSchool  Registration</a>, which allows parents of multiple students to "snap"  information from one student to another, collects relevant data based on  previously entered information and reviews, polishes and formats data for the <a href="http://www.powerschool.com/powerschool-sis/" target="_blank">PowerSchool student  information system</a>.</p>
<p>"Both our parents and school staff were spending a lot  of time managing paperwork every year," said Priscilla Thompson, student  information systems coordinator for the district, in a prepared statement. "PowerSchool  Registration provides us with the opportunity to improve efficiency, accuracy  of student data and engagement with our families."</p>
