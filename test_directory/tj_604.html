<p><a href="http://bhsd228.schoolwires.net/site/default.aspx?PageID=1" target="_blank">Bremen  Community High School District 228</a> has tapped a private partner to provide  improved data management, analytics and reports in an effort to allow  administrators to focus on student success rather than data collection.</p>
<p>The district, which serves approximately 5,000 students at  four high schools and looks at metrics on a quarterly basis, decided to partner  with <a href="http://www.decisioned.com/" target="_blank">DecisionEd</a>, a provider of  tailored data warehouses and other analytics tools for schools, to better  address growing data needs.</p>
<p>"In Bremen High School District 228, we have developed a  practice of looking at indicators of success on a quarterly basis," said Corinne  Williams, assistant superintendent for teaching and learning for the district,  in a prepared statement. "These indicators include everything from  academic achievement to factors that impact the learning environment. Our need  for specific and targeted data over the last couple of years has increased,  which is requiring the use of data from multiple sources. We look to DecisionEd  as the means to pull together the data from these multiple sources in an  efficient manner."</p>

<p>DecisionEd's data warehouse combines information from  disparate databases to provide reports and dashboards designed to help improve  decision making, student success and graduation rates.</p>
<p>"Our time needs to be focused on analyzing the data and  creating solutions rather than spending time pulling the data," added  Williams. "This is why we are looking forward to working with DecisionEd."</p>
