<p><a href="http://lightsailed.com/" target="_blank">LightSail Education</a> has launched version 4.3 of its K–12 adaptive reading app with new features that open up more personalization options to teachers and students. </p>
<p>The LightSail platform provides high-quality reading materials — offered across reading and grade levels — with in-text assessments and real-time access to student data available to teachers. Its <a href="http://lightsailed.com/features/personalized-libraries/" target="_blank">library</a> contains more than 6,000 texts embedded with assessments, including commonly assigned reading books like <em>The Giver</em>, <em>The Great Gatsby</em> and <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>. Titles are presented to students in a personalized way that takes into account the student’s Lexile measure and adapts titles as they progress.   </p>
