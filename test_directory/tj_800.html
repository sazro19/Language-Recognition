<p>The <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2014/12/11/ed-tech-leaders-applaud-fcc-decision-to-increase-funding-for-broadband.aspx">$1.5 billion increase in E-rate's annual funding</a> approved by the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> last week is expected to allow 101,000 schools and 16,000 libraries to expand their high-speed broadband and WiFi access. That extra funding has been guaranteed for the next five years, and much of it is expected to allow Priority 2 funds to go further, according to Ronald Sheps, director of public sector programs at <a href="http://publicsector.westcon.com/">Westcon</a>. Sheps spoke during a webinar hosted by <a href="http://www.carouselindustries.com/">Carousel Industries</a>. Both companies provide networking and communications services and equipment in the education market. (The webinar, "How to Maximize Your E-rate Investment," is archived and available for on-demand viewing through Carousel's event website <a href="http://www.carouselindustries.com/events/maximize-e-rate">here</a>.) </p>
<p>E-rate has traditionally provided for discounts of between 20 percent and 90 percent of eligible costs for telecommunications-related services. Schools qualify for the discounts based on the number of students they have who are eligible for free and reduced lunches. The program has two levels of eligible services. Priority 1, which is always funded first, covers telecom carrier and fiber services as well as Internet access. Priority 2 provides discounts on services related to internal connections and their basic maintenance. If money remains from the pool of funding of Priority 1 services, Priority 2 services are funded, beginning with the neediest applicants first.</p>

<p>Up until now, Priority 1 requests have consumed almost all of the E-rate funding; in 2014 Priority 1 requests were the only ones fulfilled in the program. Where money has been available for Priority 2 services, funding has frequently gone only to the most economically disadvantaged districts.</p>
<p>The newly approved money is expected to cover all eligible requests from Priority 1 and stretch well into Priority 2, Sheps noted. He added that the top discount category for Priority 2 services will now be 85 percent instead of 90 percent in order to spread the funding more broadly.</p>
<p>Most of the new funds will be spent on WiFi gear. As the FCC stated in its <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-modernizes-e-rate-expand-robust-wi-fi-schools-libraries">announcement</a> of the E-rate changes, "The program improvements will target an additional $5 billion for WiFi over the next five years, which is sufficient to expand WiFi networks in all schools and libraries." The Commission predicted that the changes will "potentially" provide a 75 percent increase in WiFi funding for rural schools over the next five years, and a 60 percent increase for urban schools.</p>
<p>As Sheps explained, a "much narrower spectrum of products" will be eligible for E-rate. "Historically routers, access points, switches and internal cabling have been eligible, and they will continue to be. Components such as voice over IP cards, circuit cards… will no longer be supported in E-rate."</p>
<p>However, he added, "you're going to see a greater emphasis on a new category created for E-rate called managed internal broadband service." This category will include operation, management and monitoring of a LAN or wide area LAN, whether handled internally or through a managed service.</p>
<p><strong>Every School Will Get $9,200</strong></p>
<p>The E-rate program is also guaranteeing "every school building in the country" a minimum of $9,200, "regardless of the need," Sheps said. Here he was referring to an FCC order that allows schools seeking funding in 2015 or 2016 to request discounts on purchases of up to $150 (pre-discount) per student for Priority 2 services over a five-year period. To ensure the Priority 2 budgets are enough to meet the demands of schools with a very tiny number of students, the order has set a funding floor of $9,200.</p>
