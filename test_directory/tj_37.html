<p>2020 packed a wallop unlike any other period in living memory. The
pain is still with us — and will continue to be for a long time. But
the start of this new year brings an opportunity for us to renew our
hope and energy. How will that play out for K-12 education,
especially in the area of technology? We turned to a number of
education leaders to find out what they expect — or look forward
to — in 2021. Here's what they told us.</p>
<h3>Teachers Will
Become Massive Social Media Influencers</h3>
<p>Teachers will be
subject-matter experts who other teachers feature in video mixtapes
and that parents will follow to support their students. Expect
teachers to go live in Twitch-style "going live"
environments. What can we expect in video?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Low-stakes
    feedback will be everyone's focus in live video. A quarter of live
    video classes will be gamified, and half of all time spent on live
    videos will be round-robin style check-ins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recorded
    video will move onto the main stage. We're seeing that two-thirds of
    teacher video is recorded, which allows teachers to manage the
    one-to-many ratio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Video
    lessons will become serialized and broken down into predictable
    chunks. The maximum length student videos should be tracks by grade
    level: one minute for first graders, 12 minutes for seniors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Camera-off
    will be OK for students; audio-off will be OK for teachers. Teachers
    will learn that it's OK for students to have their cameras off. The
    goal is building a connection and getting them to engage in the
    lesson. Teachers will focus on going beyond speaking presence and
    creating lots of movement and visuals in their videos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The
    wall of text will come down. We'll see heavier use of images in
    videos for retention and accessibility. This is key for English
    Language Learners, special education students and kids with
    attention difficulties.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Privacy
Concerns Will Draw Greater Interest</h3>
<p>Alongside the
herculean and mostly successful efforts to connect students and
teachers in digital spaces during the pandemic, the past year has
also brought stories of zoombombing, proctoring and surveillance
overreach, data breaches and inequitable student access to technology
and its benefits. These events have shined a light on the privacy
concerns related to educational data and technology use.</p>
<p>In 2021, we
anticipate seeing administrators take additional measures to promote
student data privacy, including greater attention to data governance
and security measures across the kindergarten-to-college continuum.
It is essential for these efforts to include actionable data privacy
policies and practices that safeguard student data collection,
storage, sharing and use and that ensure students have equitable
access to the benefits of data and technology.</p>
<p>We also expect a
greater interest by students and their families in understanding what
data is collected about them, how their data is used, and what their
privacy rights are related to that data collection and use. Schools
and their third-party educational technology vendors will need to
work to provide greater transparency and engender trust by clearly
and regularly communicating when, how and for how long data are used.
Moreover, schools and vendors should follow through on their promises
to protect the data and information that students and families have
entrusted to them.</p>
<p>2020 was a
challenging year for education, but, if well-applied, the lessons
learned can strengthen the protection of student data privacy as we
move into 2021.</p>

of Privacy Forum</a>
