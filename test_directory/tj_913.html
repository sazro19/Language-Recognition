<p><a href="http://www.dadeschools.net/" target="_blank">Miami-Dade County Public Schools</a> — the fourth-largest district in the country — is working through its ABCDs as it pursues a voluminous infusion of technology into learning. That's how Superintendent Alberto Carvalho described the digital convergence taking place in the district he oversees. That's also roughly the order in which each phase of the plan is unfolding.</p>
<p>As CIO Debbie Karcher explained, the "A" stands for applications and content that can be accessed at any time on any machine. "B" is for broadband that would deliver a good access experience at every school. "C" — for connectivity — called for a massive implementation of wireless in all of the schools. </p>
<p>"Every school, every square foot of our district has wireless in every room," she said.</p>
<p>Now that those components are in place, the district is ready to start talking about devices, the "D" part of the initiative. By October 2014 every school in the district will be what Karcher calls "BYOD-ready." That means students and staff will be able to bring their own devices and hop on the network and use it for whatever reason. As the district is adding a sizable BYOD program, it's also deploying 15,000 tablets to seventh grade civics students and ninth grade history students, as well as computers into elementary schools.</p>

<p>Last year, in the midst of some highly publicized missteps with 1-to-1 deployments at other large school districts, Miami-Dade pulled back on the reins of its program. Karcher said that decision was primarily done to address device security and safety issues. That delay is over, and the program is back on track — in a big way.</p>
<p>Here, the team responsible for laying out a wireless network capable of supporting 345,000 students and 40,000 staff in 392 schools shares its approach for success.</p>
<p><strong>Lay the Infrastructure on Thick<br/>
</strong>Two years ago, noted Douglas Galbraith, supervisor of infrastructure and system support, the district's Internet capacity was 1 Gbps. Last year that data center core capacity doubled, and then doubled again. The increase to 4 Gbps required an upgrade of routers and switches. At the same time IT increased the pipes in its wide area network to deliver 100 Gbps capacity to each school. Within each school there's 10 Gbps capacity.</p>
<p>On top of that IT has overlaid the district wireless network, consisting of more than 20,000 access points. Two years ago that count was 2,400. Although the district has pondered the advantages of 802.11ac or 11ad, it's "still firmly entrenched in b, g and n," said Galbraith.</p>
<p>In the last year the district has installed 16,000 <a href="http://www.merunetworks.com/products/access-points/ap433.html" target="_blank">AP433</a>s from <a href="http://www.merunetworks.com/" target="_blank">Meru Networks</a>. Those network devices have been deployed, said Karcher, "without adding one single support person." Why Meru? The main reason, she explained, is because Meru's <a href="http://www.merunetworks.com/products/software/management-applications/e(z)rf-network-manager.html" target="_blank">E(z)RF Network Manager</a> allows IT to do wireless network management from end to end, including managing the access points from a central location. "When we get a support ticket, in many cases, it might just be a reset of the device. We can do that remotely. It doesn't require a visit to the access point."</p>
<p>Added Javier "Jerry" Perez, the executive director of infrastructure and system support, wireless grew in a pattern. It started with the addition of "hotspots" at each school in common areas: the auditorium, cafeteria, media center and administrative office. "From there we grew it out. When it's all said and done, there will be one access point per 30 users."</p>
