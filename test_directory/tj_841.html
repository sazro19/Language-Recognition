<p>The <a href="http://www.cenic.org/" target="_blank">Corporation for Education Network
Initiatives in California</a> (CENIC) now offers a suite of
infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud services for member institutions in
California's research and education community, eliminating the need to conduct
local procurement processes for these services.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cccco.edu/" target="_blank">California Community Colleges</a>, the <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/" target="_blank">California State University</a> and the
<a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/" target="_blank">University of California</a> systems participated in the process of selecting <a href="http://www.centurylinkcloud.com/" target="_blank">CenturyLink</a>, <a href="http://www.firehost.com/" target="_blank">FireHost</a> and <a href="http://www.verizonenterprise.com/industry/public_sector/" target="_blank">Verizon</a> as CENIC's cloud service providers, making it easier for CENIC member
institutions to adopt cloud services for research, education and administrative
activities. </p>
