<p>More than 95 percent of teachers believe the parents of  their students do not understand what the Common Core State Standards are,  according to a <a href="https://www.tutapoint.com/blog/teacher-survey-results-released-2014/" target="_blank">recent  poll</a> of veteran high school teachers in the northeastern United States. No  teachers told the surveyors they believed their students' parents knew what the  standards were and 4.4 percent said they weren't sure.</p>
<p>The majority of respondents, 42.6 percent, said it was too  early to tell if the standards will have a positive or negative effect on  student learning. Among those who did express an opinion, 64.7  percent said they "believe that the Common Core Standards are having a  negative impact on students, leaving 35.3 percent of teachers that [said they] believe  the Common Core is having a positive impact on student learning,"  according to information released by TutaPoint, the company that conducted the  study.</p>
<p>The survey polled teachers, most of whom, at 91 percent, had  at least 10 years of experience in the classroom and all of whom had at least  five, for their opinions on the Common Core, technology in the classroom and  the challenges they face in doing their jobs, among other issues.</p>

<p>More than 59 percent of teachers surveyed said they allow  students to use smartphones in the classroom. Among teachers who use smartphones,  44.9 percent said they use an iPhone, 26.9 percent said they use an Android phone,  1.1 percent said they use a Blackberry or Windows phone and 4.4 percent said  they use some other smartphone. Just over 22 percent said they use a feature  phone and 2,2 percent said they do not use a cell phone at all.</p>
<p>Popular methods for communicating with students included  email, which 75.2 percent of respondents said they use, and through a Web site,  at a rate of 71.9 percent. Slightly more than 35 percent said they communicate  with students via Google Docs and 17.9 percent through text message. Only 3.3  percent indicated they communicate with students using Facebook and the same  number said they communicate via Twitter.</p>

<li>Just over half of respondents, 51.5 percent,  said students should spend seven hours on homework each week, and nearly a  quarter, 24.6 percent, said students should be doing nine hours of homework  each week;</li>
<li>64 percent of teachers told surveyors they focus  on teaching to underperforming students and only 15.7 percent said they are  able to teach across all levels; and</li>
<li>17.9 percent of surveyed teachers said they  teach to students performing in the middle and just 2.2 percent said they teach  to their highest performing students.</li>
