<p><a href="http://www.netsupportdna.com/US/index.asp" target="_blank">NetSupport</a> has  updated its IT asset management solution to work with a wider array of  operating systems, to better manage users and more.</p>
<p>The latest iteration, NetSupport DNA: Version 4.5 — Education Edition,  adds support for iOS and Chrome in addition to macOS.  "From real-time monitoring to internet  metering and internet safety tools including keyword alerting , technicians can  now gain a complete overview of all activity — regardless of platform — and  gather data on how their technology is being used which will aid informed  decision making in the future," according to a news release.</p>
<p>The new version also offers time-based summaries of specific users, PCs  or departments, showing what time a session was logged on and off, what  applications were used and when and internet usage, all over a specified time.</p>

<p>Other new features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to use profiles to assign settings  to groups of devices or users, allowing, for example, students in some grades  but not others to access social media;</li>
<li>Use bookmarks to navigate between different  views;</li>
<li>Deny access after multiple incorrect logins;</li>
<li>The ability to check real-time performance data,  such as CPU or memory usage;</li>
<li>A "locate a user" tool that allows  staff to find and contact other users;</li>
<li>When key words are triggered, images of the user  and the screen are captured and a log of the incident is made to allow for  follow up; and</li>
<li>Teachers can "add a concern" if a  student is having an issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>"With this update to the Education Edition of DNA, we're giving  schools the ability to monitor and support users across a multi-platform  environment, which is a huge benefit for those operating a range of  technologies on site; allowing them to see all activity and apply profiles to  groups and departments to boost efficiency even further," said Al  Kingsley, managing director of NetSupport, in a prepared statement.</p>
