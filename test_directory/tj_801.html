<p class="deck" id="ph_pcontent3_3_Deck">Common wisdom says you just can't apply conditional formatting in a Google Apps spreadsheet using data from a different sheet. But here at THE Journal, we laugh in the face of wisdom, common or otherwise. But is such jocularity is justified? Read on.</p>

<p><strong>Long Story Short</strong></p>
<p>For you advanced users who want to skip ahead: You apply the conditional formatting using a custom formula and some variation on the INDIRECT function. In addition to specifying the column and row, you also specify the name of the sheet to pull the data from ("Sheet2," for example).</p>
<p>Here's a sample formula you can try on your own:</p>
<p>=if((INDIRECT("Sheet2!A"&amp;ROW()))&gt;1,1,0)=1</p>
<p>That says if a number in Sheet2, column A, corresponding row (dynamically called in this case) is greater than 1, the apply the format specified (text and background color).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The problem: Using conventional techniques, conditional formatting allows you to specify a range of cells that will determine the formatting within the same spreadsheet; the data usually cannot be taken from multiple sheets within the spreadsheet. So, for example, if you're working in Sheet1, then all of your formatting is applied to Sheet1 only.</p>

<p>But what if you want to format cells in Sheet1 based on values that appear in Sheet2?</p>
<p> There is a workaround. It involves something we've covered in the past — custom formulas — coupled with data calls that cut across sheets.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-Sheet Data Calls</strong><br/>
Google Sheets fully supports calling data from one sheet and using it in another. It's very simple using the INDIRECT function (and other means) and dynamic cell calls (which <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2014/09/23/google-sheets-using-custom-formulas-in-conditional-formatting.aspx">we covered extensively in our previous tutorial</a>). Try it out.</p>
<p>1. Make sure you have at least two sheets in your spreadsheet. You can create sheets by clicking the "+" button at the bottom of your browser window.</p>
<p> <img alt="illustration of custom formula-based condtional formatting in Google Apps Google Sheets" height="38" src="/-/media/EDU/THEJournal/Images/2014/12/20141210apps7.jpg" width="231"/></p>
<p>2. In Sheet1, type this formula into any cell in column A:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span dir="auto">=</span><span dir="auto">INDIRECT</span><span dir="auto">(</span><span dir="auto">"Sheet2!A"</span><span dir="auto"></span><span dir="auto">&amp;</span><span dir="auto">ROW</span><span dir="auto">(</span><span dir="auto">)</span><span dir="auto">)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using the exclamation point between the name of the sheet and the column and row reference, this formula displays  in a cell in Sheet1 whatever is in Sheet2 in column A in the corresponding row. ("&amp;ROW()" inserts the number of the current row into the formula dynamically, so you could apply this formula to every cell in column A without modification. Data from the corresponding row in Sheet2 will be displayed in each cell in Sheet1 to which you've applied this formula. In our next tutorial, I'll show you how to work dynamic column calls into an INDIRECT expression as well. It's a little more involved.)</p>
<p>3. Now in Sheet2, type a number or some text in the  corresponding cell. I'll type "Hey look at this" into cell A1 in Sheet2. The same text will now show up in cell A1 in Sheet1. And it will be automatically updated in Sheet1 whenever I change the text in Sheet2.</p>

<p><strong>Adapting This Trick for Conditional Formatting</strong><br/>
Now, just as we learned last time around, we can use "if" statements in concert with the INDIRECT function to apply conditional formatting by using the "Custom formula" option in the Conditional Formatting dialog.</p>
