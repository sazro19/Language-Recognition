<p>Students spend a lot time on their smartphones and tablets, and now millions worldwide will be able to complete their <a href="https://kahoot.com/" target="_blank">Kahoot!</a> homework via iOS and Android mobile devices. </p>
<p>Kahoot! on Thursday launched its mobile app in an effort to make homework fun and more social for students. The game-based learning platform is used by more than 50 million monthly active users — 2 million of which are teachers in the United States, according to information from the company.</p>

<p>With the free mobile app, teachers will now be able to assign after-class challenges to students, either by sharing a unique PIN or link via e-mail, Google Classroom or other messengers they use. The challenges called “kahoots,” or trivia quiz games, can be customized and cover a range of topics (i.e. math, history, geography). The company also <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2017/08/30/kahoot-launches-studio-of-curriculum-aligned-games-for-k12.aspx" target="_blank">recently launched an online library for curriculum-aligned kahoots</a> for K–12 classrooms.</p>

<p>On the other side of the app, students can accept challenges while at home or on-the-go. They can play in single-player or challenge modes, competing against family and friends for a more social homework experience. </p>
<p>Matthew Castilleja, an instructional technology specialist at <a href="https://www.roundrockisd.org/" target="_blank">Round Rock Independent School District</a> in Texas, beta tested the Kahoot! app and anticipates teachers will enjoy assigning kahoots as homework. He told the company that the app has the potential to “encourage students to review educational material and take learning outside the classroom walls, all in a fun and engaging way.”</p>
<p>“Teachers and students love playing Kahoot! and don’t want to stop when the bell rings,” said Erik Harrell, CEO of Kahoot! in a company statement. “Kahoot! makes learning fun — and now homework, too! We are excited to launch the app after receiving an overwhelmingly positive response from teachers and students post our beta launch in June.”</p>
<p>The app is now available in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1131203560?mt=8" target="_blank">Apple App Store</a> and on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?hl=en&amp;id=no.mobitroll.kahoot.android&amp;utm_campaign=mobileapprelease&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_source=pressrelease" target="_blank">Google Play</a>. </p>
