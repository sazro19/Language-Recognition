<p>Two non-profits are teaming up to "help finish the  job" of connecting every school and library in the country to high-speed  Internet access. <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/kids-action" target="_blank">Common Sense  Kids Action</a>, the advocacy arm of <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/" target="_blank">Common  Sense Media</a>, and the <a href="http://www.setda.org/" target="_blank">State Educational  Technology Directors Association</a> (SETDA) have introduced a new set of  resources to guide states and school districts through the process of tapping  into billions of dollars available under the newly modernized federal <a href="http://www.usac.org/sl/" target="_blank">E-rate</a> program.</p>
<p>Under changes introduced last year, the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Communications Committee</a> updated E-rate  to cover high-speed fiber and Wi-Fi projects at schools over the next five  years. The funding is generated through a small fee attached to phone bills.</p>
<p>"<a href="http://www.setda.org/priorities/equity-of-access/e-rate-modernization/" target="_blank">Equity  of Access</a>," available on the SETDA Web site, provides documents that  give an overview of E-rate changes and related topics along with sample slide  decks to help explain the revisions to policy makers and district people.</p>

<p>One person who had previewed the kit, Matt Holder, chief  operations officer for the <a href="http://www.ok.gov/sde/" target="_blank">Oklahoma State  Department of Education</a>, said the materials would simplify the  "complex E-rate program" and make it easier to communicate "with  policymakers and state leaders about the importance of E-rate funds for  broadband connectivity."</p>
<p>The two organizations said they'd be working together over  the next three years to encourage school leaders to file applications for  E-rate funding. Common Sense will also promote states setting aside funding to  use in a new state matching grant created for E-rate to make broadband projects  even more affordable for schools.</p>
<p>"I think most of us would agree that something is wrong  when coffee shops have faster Internet connections than most of our  schools," said James Steyer, CEO and founder of Common Sense, in a  prepared statement. "With the use of advanced technology for learning and  for administration, we must do everything we can now to finish the job of  connecting every classroom and library."</p>
<p>"These documents will help guide educators and policy  makers as they work to put in place high-speed bandwidth for classrooms and  libraries," added Lan Neugent, interim executive director of SETDA.  "It is essential that every child in our country be able to seamlessly  access digital resources."</p>
