Nearly 500 students in  the <a href="http://home.lausd.net/" target="_blank">Los  Angeles Unified School District</a> received <a href="https://www.zteusa.com/warp-connect" target="_blank">ZTE Warp Connect</a> hotspot devices from the telecom  company, along with along with free Internet service. The same students also  received <a href="http://store.hp.com/us/en/mdp/chromebook-344529--1" target="_blank">HP Chromebooks</a>, headphones and a backpack supplied  by the district itself.</p>
<p>When  distribution is done this year, 9,000 hotspot devices will go out to students  in LAUSD for a total of almost 22,500 in Southern California.</p>

<p>Last week  on the opposite coast 14,000 high schoolers in the <a href="http://www.dadeschools.net/" target="_blank">Miami-Dade  County Public Schools</a> were the first recipients in that school district to receive the wireless  devices as well as Samsung smartphones.</p>
<p>The  project is intended to help fill what educators have dubbed the "homework  gap" — the situation that exists when schools expect all students to be  able to use technology to do their homework, even those who lack access to  computers or internet connectivity at home.</p>
<p>School  districts can apply to the second year of the 1Million Project if they can  identify between 1,200 and 20,000 students who lack high-speed internet access  at home. The program unfolds over four years within the district, with the  expectation that the schools have community support. Applications will be  accepted through early spring 2018 for programs that will begin at the start of  the 2018-2019 school year; those beginning then will run through 2021-2022.  Students will receive free internet service through that final school year,  whether they receive their devices in the first year of the program or the  fourth year.</p>
<p>Schools  may apply to the program <a href="http://goodworks.sprint.com/1millionproject/#enrollment" target="_blank">on the 1Million Project website</a>.</p>
