<p>The new router also provides support for up to two sim cards, allowing  districts to change between wireless networks depending upon which is stronger.</p>
<p>The company has also added two new networks, doubling the number of  network providers partnering with the company and expanding coverage.</p>
<p>"SmartBus improvements with faster Education Broadband provide  students the quick, safe access they need to succeed," said Daniel Neal, Kajeet  CEO and founder, in a prepared statement. "Students can spend more time on  task and focus on learning, without worrying about slow or unreliable  connectivity on their way to and from school, athletic games, and educational  events. Kajeet aims to provide the best access to connect students to their  educational resources outside the classroom."</p>
