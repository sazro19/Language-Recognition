<p>The highest paid school superintendent in the state of  California earns almost two and a half times more than the highest paid K–12 IT  leader did. James Hammond, superintendent at <a href="http://www.omsd.k12.ca.us/" target="_blank">Ontario-Montclair School District</a>, with  nearly 22,000 students, earns $516,573 annually for pay and benefits. John  Krull earned $213,334 a year as chief technology officer for Oakland Unified,  with 49,100 students. Krull left that job to become CIO this week at <a href="https://www.seattleschools.org/" target="_blank">Seattle Public Schools</a>, with 54,000  students. Details about his new pay package were unavailable.</p>
<p>The compensation information comes from <a href="http://transparentcalifornia.com/" target="_blank">Transparent California</a>, a website  that publishes salary records for employees of K–12 public and charter schools,  special districts, colleges and universities, as well as cities and counties.</p>
<p>The highest salaries go to the IT individuals who work for  county offices of education. In the top 10 list of K–12 education-related IT  salaries, the top two spots are held by individuals who help oversee multiple  districts in the state. After that, <a href="http://home.lausd.net/" target="_blank">Los  Angeles Unified</a>, the largest school district in the country, with 639,000  students, dominates the rankings with four of the highest salaries.</p>

<p>Size of district by student count doesn't necessarily  correlate to higher salaries.
