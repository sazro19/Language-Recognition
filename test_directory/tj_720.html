<p>According to a <a href="http://www.usac.org/sl/tools/news-briefs/preview.aspx?id=607">notice</a> on its website, the Universal Service Administration Company, in consultation with the FCC and in response to a request from the country’s largest school districts, has extended the E-rate application deadline for this fiscal year by three weeks. Applications are now due by midnight EDT on April 16 instead of the original date of March 26.</p>
<p>According to the USAC, “The extension of the application window will not slow down or adversely impact the review of applications or cause a delay in issuing funding decisions for those applications which have been submitted and certified…. Those applications that have been submitted, certified and meet program requirements will likely get a decision first.”</p>
<p>The USAC also offered these three tips to applicants: </p>
<ol>
<li>If you have not yet started your FCC Form 471 application process, start it now. </li>
<li>If you have started but not submitted your FCC Form 471 application, complete and submit it as soon as possible. </li>
<li>If you have not yet certified your application, certify it now. You can certify online if you have a Personal Identification Number. You can also print a paper copy of your certification page, sign and date it, and send it to USAC. The review of your application cannot start until it has been successfully certified. </li>
</ol>
