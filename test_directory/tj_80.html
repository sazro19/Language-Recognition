<p><a href="https://www.ravemobilesafety.com/">Rave Mobile Safety</a> is making enhancements to improve how teachers, school administrators and first responders can communicate during an emergency. Through the Rave Panic Button app, school officials will be able to directly call first responders through 911 and share with them information on what is going on at the site.</p>
<p>The integrated platform provides access to control, video, electronic signage and mass notifications to improve communications with affected personnel, students and parents both on and off site. </p>
<p>"Organizations invest in a variety of safety solutions because they know the importance of a swift, coordinated response to a crisis. If those systems are not connected in an efficient way, delays and confusion are introduced, further complicating the problem at hand," said Matthew Serra, vice president of product strategy at Rave. "This integration enables the immediate and coordinated activation of all safety solutions an organization has, helping our customers achieve their end goal: keeping their constituents safe."</p>
