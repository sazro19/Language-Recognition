<p><a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/home.jsp" target="_blank">Gartner</a> has released a new report predicting that cognizant  computing, which the company says is the next phase of the personal cloud movement,  "will become one of the  strongest forces in consumer-focused IT" in the next few years to  "have an immense impact across a range of industries, including mobile  devices, mobile apps, wearables, networking, services and cloud providers."</p>
<p>"Cognizant computing is transforming  personal clouds into highly intelligent collections of mobile apps and  services," said Jessica Ekholm, research director at Gartner, in a  prepared statement.</p>
<p>With data analytics as its backbone, cognizant  computing uses simple rules and data associated with an individual to create  services and activities delivered across multiple devices. Examples include  alarms, payments, health and fitness monitoring and management and  context-specific advertisements.</p>
<p>"Cognizant computing is already beginning  to take shape via many mobile apps, smartphones and wearable devices that  collect and sync information about users, their whereabouts and their social  graph," added Ekholm. "Over the next two to five years, the Internet  of Things and big data will converge with analytics. Hence, more data will make  systems smarter." </p>

<p>As a  result, smartphones will manage many tasks, such as booking a hotel in the  event of a cancelled flight, scheduling maintenance appointments for vehicles  or sending doctors information for repeat prescription renewals, for users by  2017.</p>
<p>Cognizant  computing will also allow organizations "to better connect with customers and to create more valuable  products, services and offers," according to information released by  Gartner.</p>
<p>"By amalgamating and analyzing data in  the cloud from many sources (including apps, smartphones and wearable devices,  websites, store purchases, and social interaction), cognizant computing will  provide contextual insights," according to a company news release. This  will help organizations "to innovate and create new business opportunities  by creating hypercontextual services that will appeal to a dedicated individual  — rather than catering to the mass market. However, critical issues will have  to be addressed including consumer privacy, quality of execution and becoming a  trusted vendor."</p>
