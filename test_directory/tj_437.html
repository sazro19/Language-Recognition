<p>The <a href="https://www1.pasadenaisd.org/" target="_blank">Pasadena  Independent School District</a> will deploy an LTE broadband network for  students to access the internet from home in an effort to close performance and  homework gaps.</p>
<p>Recent demographic studies showed that two in five  households had low quality internet access or no access at all, according to information  released by the district. </p>
<p>The district selected <a href="http://www.macomp.com/" target="_blank">M&amp;A  Technology</a> to deploy 4G-LTE technology at 15 sites around the district,  tied in to Pasadena ISD's existing network.</p>
<p>"The 4G-LTE internet access will bring relevant  curriculum resources that are only available in the classroom, to families in  their homes to enable continuous learning opportunities," according to a  news release. "Students will have the opportunity to explore and expand  their knowledge of assignments in their own environment, while staying  connected to the same safe and secure network managed by the district."</p>
<p>"Equitable broadband access in school and at home is the  key to student-centered learning and decreasing the performance and homework  gaps among students," said Arthur Allen, Pasadena ISD CTO, in a prepared  statement. "The vision of this project demonstrates the Pasadena ISD Board  of Trustees' commitment to provide the best instruction to all students."</p>
