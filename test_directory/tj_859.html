<p>School leaders and public safety personnel can develop their own emergency response safety plans and make those available to staff and teachers to load onto their devices. That content can be updated as often as needed. The program also provides functionality to push notifications to users and allows users to report incidents with photos and GPS location. The plans are password-protected and shared based on user role and responsibility.</p>

<p>Users install the software like any other app. To access the safety plan, the app does not require a connection to the Internet. </p>
<p>"The unfortunate reality is that school emergencies happen and while most schools have detailed safety plans, they aren't easily accessible during a crisis situation," said company President Lee Prevost. "CrisisManager takes those plans, many of them currently paper-based, and makes them dynamic and actionable on the mobile devices of staff, faculty and even for students in colleges and universities."</p>
<p>This is the first foray into the security realm for the company. Its other products are intended for facilities and IT operations.</p>
