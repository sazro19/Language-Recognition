<p>The Consortium for School Networking (CoSN) has launched a new initiative aimed at improving leadership skills for new CTOs and other education technology leaders.</p>
<p>The program, called <a href="https://www.cosn.org/TheAcademy" target="_blank">Early Career K-12 CTO Academy</a>, is designed for new tech leaders (those with less than four years of experience) and includes "in-person workshops, online discussions and mentorship," according to CoSN.</p>
<p>"Learning never stops for educational professionals. This unique program will help school technology leaders who are new in their roles to learn from peers and seasoned CTOs, strengthen their skills and take their experiences to the next level," said Keith Krueger, CEO of CoSN, in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>Some of the focus areas include soft skills, innovation, culture and strategies for meeting the needs of diverse learners.</p>
<p>The deadline for <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/theacademy" target="_blank">applications to the Early Career K-12 CTO Academy</a> is May 6. The cost to CoSN members is $2,299. For non-members, it's $3,299. Complete details can be found at <a href="https://www.cosn.org/TheAcademy" target="_blank">cosn.org/TheAcademy</a>.</p>
