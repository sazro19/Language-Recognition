<p>Talari Networks is launching <a href="https://www.talari.com/solutions/sd-wan/cloud-connect/" target="_blank">Cloud Connect</a>,  a new  product offering targeting the growing software-defined wide-area-network (SD-WAN) space. Its aim is to prevent carrier lock-in and simplify enterprise migrations to hybrid multi-cloud networks.</p>
<p>Talari said Cloud Connect is designed to relieve the burden of those enterprises needing to implement and manage cloud infrastructure while providing them with high-quality and reliable service as they access Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and other cloud services such as Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS), cloud service gateways, and managed Network as a Service (NaaS) offerings.
</p>
<p>This, the company said, is done through its high-availability connection service called Cloud Conduit, described as a failsafe multi-link, multipath connection between a customer location and Cloud Connect point of presence (POP).

<p>"As enterprises embrace hybrid IT and multi-cloud postures in pursuit of their digital-transformation objectives, they are compelled to overhaul their WAN architectures and management models to reliably, securely, and cost-effectively deliver the cloud-based applications and services that are becoming increasingly valuable to business outcomes," Talari quoted Brad Casemore, research vice president, Datacenter Networks at IDC, as saying. "Talari Cloud Connect responds to the challenges posed by multi-cloud, offering an approach to SD-WAN that addresses the dynamic connectivity, bandwidth, and security requirements at the intelligent edge."
</p>
<p>Talari said Communication Service Providers can obtain the Cloud Connect PoP platform functionality at no additional cost for connecting with Talari SD-WAN customers, and Cloud Connect software will next month be available to existing customers at no additional cost. It offered more information on the new offering in a <a href="https://www.talari.com/video/cloud-connect/" target="_blank">video</a>.

<p>As we <a href="http://virtualizationreview.com/articles/2018/01/02/sdwan-2018.aspx" target="_blank">detailed</a> earlier this year, SD-WAN is a growing segment of the transformational software-defined movement, which is disrupting traditional networking and virtualization segments ranging from carrier networks to complete datacenters.
</p>
<p>Talari and other vendors have published <a href="https://virtualizationreview.com/articles/2016/07/29/sofware-defined-surveys.aspx" target="_blank">survey results</a> showing strong interest in SD-WANs. That interest is so strong that Talari in  2016 said nearly three-quarters of the 400-plus respondents to its survey might entertain the possibility of ripping out existing multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) systems and replacing them with SD-WAN technology.
