<p>California's <a href="http://www.smusd.us/" target="_blank">San Marino Unified School District</a> has adopted  an online registration and payment system in an effort to streamline the  processes.</p>
<p>Previously,  the 3,160-student district used a paper-based system that required distribution  and collection of 10-30 forms per student.</p>
<p>Stephen Choi,  chief technology officer for the district, said San Marino USD was looking to  achieve specific goals with a switch to an online system. "Not only were we seeking to ensure that we have updated and  accurate demographic and emergency contact information in our SIS, but we  needed to streamline our payment collection process," said Choi, in a  prepared statement.</p>
<p>The district  decided to adopt a customized solution from <a href="https://www.infosnap.com/splash/" target="_blank">InfoSnap</a> for registration as well  as the company's payment management service.</p>
<p>"We didn't  want a technical solution to be an obstacle for our parents. If families had to  jump through hoops in order to give donations, it would ultimately affect our  bottom line," said Choi, in a news release. "InfoSnap's customized  solution captured the generosity of our parents. Moving from paper to online  has exceeded our expectations for donations and funds by 100 percent."</p>
