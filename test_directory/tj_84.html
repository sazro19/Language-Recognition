<p>The <a href="https://www.cosn.org/" target="_blank">Consortium for School Networking</a> is working with <a href="https://home.edweb.net/" target="_blank">edWeb.net</a> to help rural districts with the challenges of acquiring and implementing technology solutions for their schools. The program will utilize CoSN's network of district leaders to address four key challenges in implementing technology: broadband access, funding, people and understanding the "why."</p>
<p>The initiative will consist of a series of webinars with panels of two to three leaders from rural districts who will share their experiences to help others understand how technology can fit into their specific classroom needs. The program will begin in the 2019-2020 school year.</p>
<p>"More than half of school districts are in rural areas, and CoSN is committed to developing resources to support them. We are excited to partner with edWeb on this initiative, specifically designed to meet the unique needs of rural districts looking to take the digital leap," said CoSN CEO Keith Krueger.</p>
