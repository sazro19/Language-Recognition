<p>New
York district overhauls school-to-home communications efforts with a
unified, data-rich communication platform to improve disconnected
communications with families.</p>
<p>When
I joined Mechanicville City School District in 2019, I immediately
noticed that communications to students and their families were few
and far between. I also noticed that communications between our
district and homes only included input from select staff and wasn’t
a collaborative effort. Instead of families receiving the entire
story, for example, they were only receiving bits of the information
that we really wanted to convey.</p>
<p>Without
a clear picture of what was really going on, there was a disconnect
with the community and lack of overall trust in the district. This
culture spread among students, leaving them feeling like they too
didn’t have strong relationships with their teachers or school
leaders.</p>
<p>With
all of this in mind, I knew we had to seize this critical
opportunity, tackle these challenges, and rebuild trust in our school
community. To get there, we needed to make clear, consistent, and
transparent communications a priority so that we could build a
vibrant school community with strong relationships.</p>

<h3>5
Reasons to Adopt a Unified Communications Platform 
</h3>
<p>By
adopting <a href="http://bit.ly/1jfGAFn">ParentSquare’s</a>
unified communication platform, we felt that we could create exactly
what we needed to bring our school community together — namely, a
consistent communications plan that keeps school community members
informed and allows them to voice their input.</p>
<p>Today,
our district regularly communicates with our school community in
real-time, receives parent feedback, and connects with community
members in meaningful ways. Here are five more wins that we’ve seen
since implementing our unified communication platform:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Better
	use of technology.
	Rather than sending out long emails or newsletters with a lot of
	text, we can upload videos every week with school and district
	updates. Parents can absorb a lot more information when they watch a
	quick video, and videos are also a more personal way for our school
	and district leaders to communicate home.</p>
</li></ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>A
	two-way communication stream. Our
	parents also needed a way to reach school and district leaders. The
	platform has a survey feature that we use to gather feedback from
	parents, as well as two-way communication so that parents can
	communicate with the school and district straightaway.</p>
</li></ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Leverage
	the power of the web and social media.
	Using the platform’s Social Share feature, we can post information
	directly to our website, Twitter, or Facebook. This gives parents
	multiple places to find information, which is an improvement from
	our previous, limited communications approach.</p>
</li></ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Real-time
	insights and analytics.
	We now have powerful dashboards that provide real-time insights and
	analytics. These tools help us identify the parents and guardians
	that we are not
	reaching,
	so we can find alternative methods to connect. Additionally, we can
	ensure contact data is accurate and up-to-date, so everyone has a
	chance to engage with important communications.</p>
</li></ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Address
	COVID-19 protocols.
	Students and staff can fill out their Health Screening Form in the
	platform’s app, making an otherwise lengthy screening process more
	efficient, and helping our school community maintain compliance with
	state-specific and CDC-guidelines surrounding COVID-19.</p>
</li></ol>
<h3>Building
a Better-Connected School District</h3>
<p>I’m
happy to report that our district has successfully reached its
reimagined goal to provide consistent, transparent, purposeful, and
timely communications to all school community members regarding
district business with a special focus given to district goals. In
fact, the platform made it really easy for us to rebuild our
communications process from scratch. The district completely
transformed its communications program so that every family is now
informed and engaged, resulting in a more unified school community
with strong trust.</p>
