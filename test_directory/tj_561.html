<p>It is widely understood among  K-12 educators and administrators that students need high-speed broadband access  to the Internet, both at school and at home, to take full advantage of the online  learning resources that have become a fundamental part of the 21st  century classroom. But it's also dawning on a growing number of employers that broadband  access in the home might be as essential as school access to the development of  a tech-savvy workforce.</p>
<p>Social programming giant <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> threw a spotlight on the issue in December when the  company invited local elected officials and members of the tech community to  its San Francisco headquarters to meet with Julián Castro, Secretary of Housing  and Urban Development (HUD), to learn about the <a href="http://connecthome.hud.gov/">ConnectHome</a> initiative. Castro returned to Silicon Valley less  than a month later to participate in a "fireside chat" at Google headquarters  with Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, where they also discussed, among  other topics, ConnectHome.</p>

<br/><p>Announced in July by the  Obama Administration, ConnectHome is a pilot program that aims to accelerate  broadband adoption by families living in HUD-assisted housing through  partnerships with private companies, non-profits, local communities, and the  federal government. The initial goal of the program is to bring high-speed  broadband access and tech tools to 275,000 low-income households across the  country. The program is targeting 27 cities in the United States, including Newark,  Seattle and Atlanta, as well as the Choctaw Nation in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>"This is fundamentally about  sparking greater opportunity in the lives of families of modest means and  ensuring that 21st century America remains the undisputed land of opportunity  for all people," Castro told reporters during his GitHub visit. </p>
<p>HUD has determined that more  than half of all low-income families in this country are not currently  connected to the Internet, Castro said. The ConnectHome initiative is building  on the existing <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/k-12/connected">ConnectED</a> project to change that statistic and ensure that the Internet "follows young  people home," he said. </p>
<p>The initiative's primary goal  is to connect families to the Internet that are not currently connected, Castro  explained, but it's also designed to make those connections "meaningful" by  providing the HUD residents with tools and education — what the ConnectHome  site describes as "localized, free and culturally sensitive training in  essential digital literacy skills that will allow them to effectively utilize  high-speed Internet." </p>
<p>"At the end of this what we  want is that connection and for folks to be able to make the most of it,"  Castro said. "That's what GitHub and others are helping us with." </p>
<p>GitHub was among the first  companies to join the ConnectHome effort. The company announced in July that it  would contribute $3 million worth of free private repositories for  participants, $250,000 in financial support, and 2,000 hours in volunteer time "to  train, coach and mentor those who want to build a career in software  development," the company said in a statement. During Castro's visit to San  Francisco, GitHub CEO Chris Wanstrath doubled his company's commitment to the  project, pledging $500,000 and 4,000 volunteer hours to the initiative. </p>
<p>Partnering with ConnectHome  was the first action of GitHub's new Social Impact Team, currently led by  Nicole Sanchez. That group was organized to "leverage resources and people  power to cultivate positive change in open source, tech, and communities across  the U.S. and internationally," the company said in a statement. </p>
<p>GitHub's altruistic  intentions notwithstanding, the company's participation in the ConnectHome  effort is also an example of the private sector acting in its own enlightened  self-interest to support K-12 education. GitHub is a Web-based hosting service  that provides software developers (primarily) with a publishing tool, a version  control system and a collaboration platform. The free private repositories the  company is contributing are online storage directories used by its customers. </p>
