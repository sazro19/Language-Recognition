<p>In effect, <a href="https://thejournal.com/beingmobile">our blog posts</a> over the past year are about identifying the issues involved in the following absolute truism: <em>the key</em> to the successful and productive use of technology in the K-12 classroom <a href="https://thejournal.com/Articles/2017/01/03/Memo-to-OER-Purveyors.aspx?Page=1">starts</a> with good curriculum.  Herewith, then, is yet another set of issues that must be addressed! </p>

<p>It doesn’t take a <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2017/03/29/open-educational-resources-movement-scales-up-oer.html">crystal ball</a> to see that <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/05/19/8-high-quality-oer-collections.aspx">OERs</a> — Open Education Resources — are the future of curriculum. That said, turning OER into actual, coherent, cohesive, aligned curricular lessons is fraught with <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2017/05/22/the-new-new-thing.aspx">challenges</a>. The particular challenge under our microscope here is this: we aren’t seeing support for the <em>full life-cycle</em> of an <a href="https://www.oercommons.org/login?next=/courseware/lesson/add">OER-based lesson</a> on OER websites. Say what? </p>
<p>Let’s step back — in time — to when curriculum was "<a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/10/04/curricular-transition-from-atoms-to-bits-is-a-work-in-progress.aspx">atoms (paper) based</a>" in contrast to today’s OER-curriculum that are "<a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/10/04/curricular-transition-from-atoms-to-bits-is-a-work-in-progress.aspx">electronic bits-based</a>." While it might not have been explicit, there was nonetheless a "life-cycle" to a lesson that teachers followed: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lesson development:</strong>  Teachers typically would be provided with textbook-based lessons. Of course, teachers would tweak those lessons to better suit the specifics of their classrooms, e.g., differentiating for the struggling and the accelerated learners, localizing to make a lesson more geographically-based, etc. </li>
<li><strong>Lesson distribution:</strong> Next, distributing a lesson to the students typically involved handing out a piece of paper, writing information on the blackboard, or simply telling students what to do.  </li>
<li><strong>Lesson enactment: </strong>Next, teachers were intimately involved in lesson enactment — as often, the lesson started with a monologue, with the classroom of students then working pretty much in lock-step. </li>
<li><strong>Lesson assessment:</strong> Assessment was done by a teacher walking around and/or by taking papers home for subsequent grading.  </li>
<li><strong>Lesson sharing and reflecting:</strong> Teachers would share tips about enactment, grading, etc. in the hallway and/or the teacher’s lounge. Teachers would make notes on how the lesson went — and would use those notes to guide the reuse of that lesson during the next school year. </li>
</ul>
<p>Paper and a teacher’s filing system, then, were the key technologies providing support for the life-cycle of atoms-based lessons. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the bits-based, <a href="https://tech.ed.gov/open/">OER curriculum world</a>, the <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/07/02/16-oer-sites-every-educator-should-know.aspx">OER websites</a> tend to provide basic support for "<a href="https://www.oercommons.org/login?next=/courseware/lesson/add">lesson development</a>" and very basic support for "lesson distribution" but not much support for the those other phases of the life-cycle. </p>
