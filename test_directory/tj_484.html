<p><a href="http://www.identityautomation.com" target="_blank">Identity Automation's</a> <a href="http://www.identityautomation.com/product" target="_blank">RapidIdentify</a> software — intended to make access and account management for school
districts
and other large organizations with complicated IT infrastructures
easier — has been
certified by the <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org" target="_blank">IMS Global Learning Consortium</a> for
its <a href="http://www.oneroster.org" target="_blank">OneRoster</a> standard.</p>
<p>Because it now has been
certified by OneRoster, school districts can, for instance, safely pass
information about students and teachers onto textbook distributors at
the
beginning of each semester.</p>
<p>RapidIdentity
software was built to automate and simply the
management of complex IT systems with multiple users and grant secure
access to
the right people at the right time.</p>
<p>"This
is often a challenge for curriculum professionals who don't necessarily
have a technology background," said Identity Automation CTO Troy
Moreland. "This
allows schools to focus scarce resources on identifying the right
curriculum,
rather than spending time and effort trying to make it work."</p>

<p>The
OneRoster standard is a subset of the Learning Information
Services standard that focuses on a school's needs to exchange roster
information and grades. The
mission of the IMS Global Learning Consortium,
a nonprofit member organization, is to advance technology that can
affordably
scale and improve educational participation and attainment.</p>
<p>IMS's
network of educational institutions, suppliers and government
organizations develops open interoperability standards, supports
adoption with
technical services and encourages adoption through programs that <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/learningimpact/li.html">highlight effective
practices</a>.</p>
<p>"Using
a product like Identity Automation, which supports a full range
of certified-compliant options, provides districts with flexibility to
start
with a basic daily exchange of roster information and move to a more
sophisticated real-time exchange of roster information to really fit
the needs
of the educators and the students," said IMS Global Vice President of
Product
Management Mark Leuba.</p>
