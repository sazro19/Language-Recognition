<p><a href="http://www.psd1.org/" target="_blank">Pasco School District</a> in Washington state
is replacing its existing one-gigabit Internet service with a 20-gigabit fiber
optic network to provide ultra-high speed Internet service to its 24 school
district facilities.</p>
<p>The district is funding the network upgrade with help from the Federal
Communication Commission's (FCC) <a href="http://www.usac.org/sl/" target="_blank">E-rate</a>
program, which was created to help schools and libraries implement Internet
access. Pasco School District selected <a href="http://www.fatbeam.com/" target="_blank">Fatbeam</a> as its service provider because the
company provides competitive options for smaller markets.</p>
<p>"Markets under 150,000 in population are frequently lacking
competitive options for fiber based services," said Greg Green, president
of Fatbeam, the company that is implementing the network. Once Fatbeam builds a
fiber optic network for a school district, it extends the service to local
hospitals, banks, government offices and other organizations in the community,
including telecom and Internet carriers.</p>

<p>Fatbeam is currently in the process of engineering and designing Pasco's
30-mile fiber optic network, which dedicates four fibers into each district
facility to provide redundancy and resiliency. The network is expected to be in
place by June 2016, when the agreement between Pasco School District and
Fatbeam takes effect. According to information from Fatbeam, the upgrade will
reduce the district's cost-per-megabit by as much as 94 percent.</p>
<p>In related news, <a href="http://www.bend.k12.or.us/" target="_blank">Bend School
District</a> in Oregon has also signed a long-term agreement with Fatbeam to
build a 20-gigabit lit fiber optic network to provide the district's 23
facilities with ultra-high speed Internet service.</p>
