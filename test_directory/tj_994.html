<p>A new <a href="http://www.aascalifornia.org/index2.jsp" target="_blank">Academy of Arts and
Sciences</a> charter school in California has opened its doors to students and
refurbished computers. </p>
<p>Administrators at the school wanted to provide students with access to the
latest technology but weren't prepared to pay the whopping price tag of $350,000
it would cost to buy more than 350 MacBooks directly from Apple. "We searched
everywhere for the highest quality technology available within our budget," said
Sean McManus, CEO of the Academy of Arts and Sciences, in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>Instead of buying new, the administrators turned to
<a href="http://www.mactoschool.com/" target="_blank">Mac to School</a>, a company that buys,
sells and refurbishes Apple computers and equipment for the education market. By
opting for refurbished equipment, administrators were able buy those 350
MacBooks at a price approximately $245,000 less than buying new, according to
Mac to School.</p>
<p>Even schools that want to buy new equipment can benefit from working with
refurbished technology companies like Mac to School. Schools looking to upgrade
can sell their used equipment to the refurbishers and use the funds to offset
the cost of new equipment.</p>
