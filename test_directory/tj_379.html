<p>Two Willamette Valley school administrators have resigned after being placed on leave for sending text messages in which they mocked former students, according to the <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2017/01/28/oregon-school-officials-resign-for-mocking_ap.html?utm_source=fb&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=mrss&amp;cmp=RSS-FEED" target="_blank">Associated Press</a> and <a href="http://registerguard.com/rg/news/local/35218369-75/two-creswell-high-school-administrators-step-down-in-face-of-texting-scandal.html.csp" target="_blank">The Register-Guard</a>.</p>
<p>The Register-Guard reports that Superintendent Todd Hamilton announced the resignations of Creswell High School Principal Andy Bracco, 45, and Assistant Principal and Athletic Director Jordan Osborn, 31, Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>The two faced a barrage of community criticism over negative text messages they exchanged about two former Creswell students, both female. The text conversation happened Jan. 13 during a high school basketball game. A person in the stands took a photograph over Osborn’s shoulder of the texts to Bracco on his phone, then shared it on social media.</p>

<p>One text made fun of a student’s weight, while another suggested a former student was using illegal drugs — namely cocaine.</p>
<p>Bracco, reached by e-mail Friday, said his actions were inexcusable.</p>
<p>“I feel terrible that my career in education is probably over, but I feel worse for the people that I’ve hurt,” <a href="http://registerguard.com/rg/news/local/35218369-75/two-creswell-high-school-administrators-step-down-in-face-of-texting-scandal.html.csp" target="_blank">Bracco told The Register-Guard</a>.</p>
<p>Osborn, who was also reached by e-mail, offered a comment before his resignation was announced.</p>
<p>“I am deeply sorry for my extremely poor behavior and the pain and embarrassment it has cause the students, staff, families and the community,” he said.</p>
<p>Former Creswell teacher and retired administrator Marcy Rice has stepped in as interim principal.</p>
<p>The announcements of the resignations came just as a group of about 50 Creswell High students began a planned walkout — an event the students had organized earlier in the week to protest the actions of their administrators.</p>
