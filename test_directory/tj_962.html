<p>"Technology has changed; the needs of schools have changed; the E-rate  program must reflect this change." So said Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in a <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/document/chairman-wheeler-remarks-ccsso-legislative-conference" target="_blank">talk</a> to a group assembled by the <a href="http://www.ccsso.org/" target="_blank">Council of Chief State School Officers</a> in mid-March. His talk was but the latest in a flurry of activity around the E-rate  in particular and the federal role in educational technology in general. </p>
<p>The positive flurry began in June 2013. In a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/06/remarks-president-mooresville-middle-school-mooresville-nc" target="_blank">speech</a> at <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/mgsd.k12.nc.us/mooresville-middle-school/" target="_blank">Mooresville Middle School</a> (NC), President Obama announced his<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/06/06/what-connected" target="_blank"> ConnectED</a> initiative and directed the FCC "to begin a process that will connect 99 percent of America's students to high-speed broadband Internet within five years." </p>

<p>In February 2014, the President <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/02/04/fact-sheet-opportunity-all-answering-president-s-call-enrich-american-ed" target="_blank">announced</a> more than $750 million in private-sector commitments to deliver "cutting-edge technologies to classrooms, including devices, free software, teacher professional development and home wireless connectivity." Seven companies answered the President's call for donations and others followed in subsequent days. Thus far, no details are yet available about how those goods and services might be distributed, but the commitment from those companies remains. Obama also announced that the FCC had found an additional $2 billion in the E-rate  program over the next two years. Finally, the President released his <a href="http://www.ed.gov/budget15" target="_blank">budget</a> in March, including a new $200 million request for an educational technology program, <a href="http://www.ed.gov/connecteducators" target="_blank">ConnectEDucators</a>, which "would provide funding to help educators leverage technology and data to provide high-quality college- and career-ready instruction that meets the needs of all students." </p>
<p> Given the ongoing dysfunction in Congress, it is impossible to know whether the President's budget request will go very far, but if we turn our eyes to the E-rate , there is no doubt that action is imminent. Just three months after the President announced the ConnectED initiative in Mooresville, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rule-Making (<a href="http://www.fcc.gov/e-rate-update" target="_blank">NPRM</a>) regarding the E-rate . Over the next few months, the FCC received more than 1,500 comments in response to the NPRM. On March 6, the Wireline Competition Bureau of the FCC released a <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/document/focused-comment-sought-e-rate-modernization" target="_blank">Public Notice</a> seeking comment on a much narrower set of issues regarding the E-rate . In addition, there have been a number of speeches by FCC commissioners, the most noteworthy being FCC Chairman Wheeler's speech and Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel's <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/document/remarks-commissioner-rosenworcel-sxswedu-conference-and-festival" target="_blank">speech</a> at SXSWedu. </p>
<p>While the Public Notice is a very different document than the two speeches and has a very different purpose, it does address three overriding concerns: 1) How to best focus E-rate  funds on high capacity broadband, especially within the school; 2) whether and how to phase out legacy programs such as voice; and 3) whether and how to create programs to maximize cost-effective purchasing. </p>
<p>Looking at the Public Notice and Commissioner Rosenworcel's and Wheeler's talks, we can see some pretty solid hints about what will happen with the E-rate  over time and what you might begin considering in your districts.</p>
