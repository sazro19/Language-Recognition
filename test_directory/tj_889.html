<p><a href="http://www.senkatel.com/en/" target="_blank">Senkatel</a> has  introduced a Chromebook specifically tailored for the K-12 classroom.  The <a href="http://www.senkatel.com/en/products/tablet-pc/c1101-chromebook" target="_blank">C1101 Chromebook</a> is a new version of the product Senkatel already produces,  but designed to stand the rigors of the classroom and the average student.</p>
<p>Features of the C1101 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 3-cell, 36-watt-hour battery that operates for up to 9.5 hours on a single  charge, able to last throughout an entire school day. The  battery can  be serviced by the school's IT staff, eliminating downtime and  warranty issues;</li>
<li>A water-resistant   keyboard  with anti-peel keys and a touchpad that channels  liquid away from the electronics to prevent damage;</li>
<li>A rugged design capable of withstanding bumps and drops of more than 2  feet;</li>
<li>Reinforced areas around all ports, the security lock slot and mechanical  hinges;</li>
<li>An integrated carry handle that allows students to hang the  device in their lockers when not in use, rather than vertically stacking heavy items on it; and</li>
<li>More Internet access flexibility than most consumer-grade tablets and  Chromebooks in order to accommodate some school systems' legacy wireless  infrastructures.</li>
</ul>
