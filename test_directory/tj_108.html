<p>An Arizona school system has enhanced its virtual desktop  implementation to simplify IT management and improve performance and security. <a href="https://www.susd12.org/" target="_blank">Sunnyside Unified School  District</a> chose <a href="https://www.hiveio.com/" target="_blank">HiveIO</a> from a company with the same  name.</p>
<p>The district IT organization, serving 16,300 students in 20  schools, sought a way to continue growing its infrastructure while streamlining  the IT experience and making operations transparent to users. Sunnyside chose  the company's hyperconverged fabric platform to reside on top of its existing  hardware to create a virtual desktop ecosystem managed from a single viewpoint.</p>
<p>"Prior to the Hive Fabric deployment, the Sunnyside IT  team was using four different vendors on a traditional three-tier architecture,  with separate boxes from separate vendors for compute, network and  storage," said CIO, Javier Baca, in a statement. "We selected HiveIO  because it was an easier-to-manage [virtual desktop infrastructure] solution  that provided simple scalability and was just as robust as our current stack.  Hive Fabric also helped the district transition from managing individual  desktops to pools of desktops, which freed up our IT resources, allowing the  team to focus on delivering an even better experience to our staff and  students."</p>

<p>The new virtual desktop infrastructure now offers the  ability for students to access their profiles no matter what computing device  they're using and lets IT roll out Windows operating system and application updates  more efficiently behind the scenes, without user awareness.</p>
