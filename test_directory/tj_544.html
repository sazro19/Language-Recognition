<p>New Hampshire's <a href="http://www.sau74.org/" target="_blank">Barrington  School District SAU 74</a> has adopted a customized online student registration  system in an effort to ensure student data is up to date on the first day of  school and to replace a paper-based process.</p>
<p>"Our parents were tasked with filling out a variety of  forms every school year," said Nancy Vincent, director of technology for  the district, in a prepared statement. "We're streamlining this  process by eliminating paper and modernizing our approach to the student  registration process."</p>
<p>The district chose a solution from <a href="http://www.powerschool.com/" target="_blank">PowerSchool</a>, which also provides Barrington  SD's student information system (SIS). The new tool allows families with more  than one student to snap information from one child's entry to another and  features SmartForm technology, which collects data based on previously entered  information and choices.</p>
<p>"We're eliminating an extensive amount of hours that  administrators previously spent inputting data into our SIS," added  Vincent. "The solution will increase efficiency at the district and  provide a user-friendly experience for our families."</p>
