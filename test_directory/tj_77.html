<p>Through decades in district communications, I’ve seen our ability to reach stakeholders more effectively blossom, from websites to mobile devices to social media. But with all those new channels has come the responsibility for managing them. How can a communications director effectively control the firehose of information without getting bogged down in website maintenance or constantly responding to a plethora of social media accounts? At the<a href="https://www.sheldonisd.com/"> </a><a href="https://www.sheldonisd.com/">Sheldon Independent School District</a>, we manage through a combination of outsourcing what we need to and sharing responsibility internally where we can.</p>
<h3>Outsourcing the Website</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, maintaining a district website was optional. It was a nice thing to have, a way to be on the cutting edge. These days, however, it’s a necessity. Families expect to be able to find information there, such as our code of conduct, dress code, back-to-school information, and board policies. In Texas, as in other states, we have web standards that stipulate a number of things we must include on our website by law, such as posted information about school board meeting notices at least 72 hours in advance, or student health advisory committee policies and procedures.</p>

<p>When I first started working with websites for school districts in the 1990s, not only were they optional, they were pretty basic. We didn’t have a lot of choices as far as services to choose from, and the what-you-see-is-what-you-get design templates didn’t exist. Dreamweaver and open-source options were our best choices in those days.</p>
<p>Managing a district website efficiently with those services required third-party extensions and plugins, however, and as websites became more widespread, so too did attacks on websites, and those third-party add-ons lacked security and became an open door for hackers.</p>
<p>Between the increased compliance requirements and security issues, I eventually found that paying for a content management system (CMS) was worth the cost. We were looking for a company that focused exclusively on websites and communications tools for K–12, met performance standards we focused on such as uptime — the percentage of time a service is functioning and available — and was affordable. We chose to go with<a href="https://edlio.com/"> </a><a href="https://edlio.com/">Edlio</a>.</p>
<h3>Sharing Communications Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Outsourcing the CMS may take the technical responsibilities off a communications director’s plate — and help you breathe easier about security and compliance — but there’s still an awful lot of information to manage. We do this by sharing the responsibility for that information with the people closest to it by, for example, having teachers manage their own classroom or personal pages.</p>
<p>We don’t have any requirements for what or how frequently teachers post to their classroom pages — they have enough to do already. But many of them choose to post homework assignments, notices to parents, classroom photos or videos, or even blogs about classroom experiences to better engage parents and guardians in their students’ educations.</p>
<p>To get teachers up to speed on managing their pages and all the capabilities available to them through the CMS, we have them attend 55-minute professional development sessions during in-service days. With the help of a colleague, I host five sessions a day, and afterwards teachers are cranking out their own pages within an hour.</p>
<h3>Connecting via Social Media</h3>
<p>No matter how well designed and interactive your website is, social media is a critical component of district communications. People will go to the website when they’re looking for information, but when you want to push out information they may not already be looking for, social media is the way to put it in front of them, because they’re already checking those channels for their own personal reasons.</p>
