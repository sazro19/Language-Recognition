<p><a href="http://www.hendersonisd.org/campus/HendersonISD_Northside_School-3.aspx" target="_blank">Northside  Intermediate School</a> in Texas is replacing textbooks with digital books and iPads  in an effort to improve learning outcomes and provide instant feedback.</p>
<p>Every student at the school has  access to the devices throughout the day, allowing them to iPads to read,  practice their writing, study math or science or engage in other learning  activities.</p>
<p>The iPads also provide students  with instant grading feedback and are being used in some math classes as  student response devices or for quizzing students.</p>
<p>"I've had some great response from  teachers and students and so we are very excited that it's been successful,  that teachers are learning best ways to implement technology into the classroom  while still meeting the State of Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills and so we  feel like it's giving our students an edge," said Stacey  Johnson, director of human resources and communications for <a href="http://www.hendersonisd.org/default.aspx" target="_blank">Henderson Independent School  District</a> (HISD), in a <a href="http://www.ketknbc.com/news/northside-intermediate-using-ipads-in-the-classroo" target="_blank">local  news report</a>.</p>

<p>As a result of Northside's  success, HISD is looking into expanding the initiative to other schools.</p>
<p>"The iPad is a lot more dynamic,"  said Kevin Bryan, director of technology for HISD. "It's a device that has  an abundance of apps. In math, they work on math problems, but what's nice  about the textbook is they can actually watch a video explanation on anything  that they're working on if they're confused about a concept or a topic. Science  is that same way."</p>
