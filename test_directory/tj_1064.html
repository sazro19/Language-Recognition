<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/business/by-industry/education/" target="_blank">Samsung</a> has taken the wraps off a Galaxy Tab  tablet that will be purpose-built for education. </p>
<p>According to Samsung, the device, which will be made available for the 2014–2015 school year, will launch as part of the <a href="https://www.google.com/edu/tablets/" target="_blank">Google Play for Education program</a>. Google Play for Education is a solution that puts  approved educational apps and educator-curated  resources on mobile devices, along with tools for simplified setup, "instant" app deployment and Web-based management. Content is organized by grade, subject and standard. Google Play for Education also provides the means for school to buy apps via purchase order.</p>
