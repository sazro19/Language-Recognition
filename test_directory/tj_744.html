<p><a href="https://www.freshgrade.com/" target="_blank"><img alt="FreshGrade allows teachers to add student tags to learning artifacts for automatic inclusion in e-portfolios." height="474" src="/-/media/EDU/THEJournal/Images/2015/03/20150303_FreshGrade.png" style="float: right;" width="300"/>FreshGrade</a> has  released a free new iPad app, also called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/freshgrade-free-education/id945490163?mt=8" target="_blank">FreshGrade</a>,  designed to help teachers efficiently capture, document and share student  learning with parents in real time.</p>
<p>FreshGrade allows teachers to document learning through  videos, images, audio, notes and assessment scores. Those artifacts are then  tagged with one or more students' names for automatic posting to learning  portfolios accessible for review through a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/freshgrade-for-parents/id886872010?mt=8" target="_blank">parent  app</a>. Parents and students are able to comment on portfolio activity to  collaborate with the teacher.</p>
<p>"For older grades, teachers can also set  assignments for the students and have them document their own learning, upload  files and make self-reflections through the dedicated student app,"  according to a news release. "These flipped classroom capabilities are  particularly useful for reducing workload for secondary teachers that have  multiple classes."</p>

<p>"Right now, report cards are a periodic event that  provides limited insight into the progress of a child's learning, the work that  the teacher does to support that child or context for why the specific grade  was given," said FreshGrade CEO Lane Merrifield, in a prepared statement. "Our  goal is to provide more meaningful information in real-time rather than at the  end of each term."</p>
