<p>At 7:45 a.m. on Monday, April 8, 2013, 23,000 network users in the <a href="http://www.rss.k12.nc.us/"><strong>Rowan-Salisbury School System</strong></a>’s<strong> </strong>35 schools were<a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a> accessing their Web-based curriculum resources and administrative applications when suddenly all Internet connectivity stopped. The outage lasted for about an hour. Teachers had to quickly switch their lessons to a Plan B, since most had components that required Internet access.</p>
<p>Internet connectivity returned briefly, but suddenly went down again for another hour. The Internet would go down for a third time before school ended.</p>

<p>The Internet outages weren’t due to hardware failures, Internet provider outages or network maintenance. The school district was under attack — specifically, we were experiencing a distributed denial-of-service attack, or DDoS. DDoS attacks, one of the most common forms of cyberattack, are designed to overwhelm a targeted IP address with numerous network requests in order to interrupt or suspend network service.</p>
<p>Each morning for the next four days, the district lost Internet connectivity around 7:45 a.m. The Internet would remain down for about an hour and would go down two more times each day. During the next three weeks, the school system was attacked multiple times a day on eight different days. Each attack caused a loss of Internet connectivity.  A great frustration among students and staff ensued. Teaching and learning was being significantly impacted.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying the Problem</strong><br/>
The school system’s Internet connection was a 1 Gb connection. It was provided by the state of North Carolina as part of the <a>North Carolina Research and Education Network</a> (NCREN). This network serves all the state’s public education facilities, as well as many private colleges and universities and the NC Office of Information Technology. The NCREN system is managed by MCNC, a nonprofit organization. During the three weeks of Internet outages, numerous conversations took place between the MCNC staff and the district’s technology department. It wasn’t until the third day of Internet outages that MCNC identified DDoS attacks as the cause of the outages. Data analysis showed that the district’s network was being attacked with as much as 6.4 Gb per second. The attack was focused on the public IP of the district’s firewall. The purpose of the attack was to disrupt Internet connectivity to and from the school district. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, MCNC wasn’t able to stop the DDoS attack at the perimeter of the NCREN Internet connection. Stopping the DDoS attack at the perimeter is essential to mitigate its effect on a network. Instead, MCNC implemented several measures to try to mitigate the attacks. These helped preserve connectivity for the other organizations sharing the network connection line with Rowan-Salisbury, but Internet connectivity for the district continued to be disrupted.</p>
<p>The district got some help from a retired 3Com/HP network engineer, Larry Tolbert. He had over 30 years of network engineering experience and was very familiar with Rowan Salisbury’s network.  After the district leveraged several of its infrastructure components to obtain additional information about the DDoS attack and to block the attack at the perimeter of the district’s network, Tolbert configured the district’s <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/ngips-intrusion-prevention-system/index.html?">TippingPoint</a> Intrusion Protection System (IPS) to capture packet data of future attacks for analysis. He also configured the IPS to prevent future attacks from reaching the district’s firewall and to send alerts to the technology department at the start of any future attack.</p>
