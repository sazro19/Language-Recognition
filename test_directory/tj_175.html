<p>Revenue for server sales increased 2.8 percent year over year in the  second quarter of 2017, outstripping shipments, which were up 2.4 percent during  the same period, according to a new report from <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/home.jsp" target="_blank">Gartner</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html" target="_blank">Hewlett Packard Enterprise</a> (HPE) continued to lead the market despite slipping in both revenue and market  share. The company held a 23 percent share of the market for the quarter on $3.2  billion in revenue, down from $3.5 billion in sales and a 26.1 percent share during  the same period last year.<br/>
<br/>
  In shipments, HPE came in second, moving about 483,000 units, down year over  year from 529,000, enough to drop from a 19.2 percent market share to 17.1  percent.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dellemc.com/en-us/index.htm" target="_blank">Dell EMC</a> remained  in second place with positive growth, improving revenue from $2.6 billion and a  19.1 percent share of the market in last year's second quarter to $2.8 billion  and 19.9 percent of the market in the most recent quarter.</p>

<p>Dell also saw a drop in the number of sales from last year's second  quarter to this year's, falling from 529,000 to 493,000, though the less  precipitous decline allowed the company to edge out HPE for market leader with  17.5 percent of the market as measured by number of sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en/" target="_blank">IBM</a>, in third place, saw its  server revenue fall off from 1.2 billion and a 9.1-percent share to $960  million and a 6.9-percent share. Revenue for the company's server sales,  however, was not enough to crack the top five.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cisco.com/" target="_blank">Cisco</a> holds the fourth spot and saw  its revenue improve from $859 million to $866 million year over year, while its  market share declined slightly from 6.3 to 6.2 percent. As with IBM, the  company's server revenue for the quarter was not enough to place it in the top  five.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.huawei.com/us/" target="_blank">Huawei's</a> revenue increased from $536  million and a 4-percent share in last year's second quarter to $846 million and  a 6.1 percent in the most recent period. The company also made a showing as the  third market leader by shipments, at 176,426, good enough for a 6.2 percent  share.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.inspur.com/" target="_blank">Inspur Electronics</a> held the fourth  spot for market share by shipment volumes, moving 158,373 units in this year's  second quarter for a 5.6 percent share.</p>
<p><a href="http://www3.lenovo.com/us/en/" target="_blank">Lenovo</a> follows them in the  fifth spot at 145,655 sales and a 5.2-percent share.</p>
