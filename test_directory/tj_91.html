<p>People in education are more likely to click on phishing e-mails than any other major segment, according to the latest <a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/" target="_blank">Verizon data breach report</a>. Almost five people in 100 (4.93 percent) in education would mistakenly click on risky links during phishing tests.</p>
<p>For this year's findings, Verizon analyzed a total of 101,168 security incidents across multiple industries from 73 separate data sources (66 of which were from organizations outside of Verizon). The education sector made up a tiny portion of the total — 382 incidents, involving some 99 confirmed data breaches.</p>
<p>Denial of service made up the vast majority of those incidents — about 59 percent of the total. However, the DoS events didn't necessarily result in breaches. Of those, the researchers counted 61 actual breaches. The largest share — 35 breaches — occurred during what they called "miscellaneous errors," incidents in which unintentional actions compromised a security attribute of an asset. Most of the time, these involved sending or publishing sensitive data to the wrong place or misconfiguring servers.</p>

<p>Web application attacks made up about a quarter of breaches in education, most coming from the "frequent compromise of cloud-based mail services via phishing links to phony login pages," the report explained. Verizon's advice: If you use cloud-based mail services, "consider tightening up your password security and implement a second authentication factor and then turning off IMAP."</p>
<p>In those breaches that were "known," the primary motivation was financial, up 33 percent between 2016 and 2018, and the probable perpetrators were "organized criminal groups."</p>
<p>The report noted a drop in "state-affiliated or cyber-espionage cases," down 31 percent this year compared to 2016. However, the researchers warned, this doesn't mean those players have stopped looking for intellectual property on campus servers; rather, the findings are limited to the specific data provided by sources in this year's compilation.</p>
<p>As always, the report offered specific guidance for people in the education sector:</p>
<p>First, stay on top of digital hygiene: "Clean up human error to the best extent possible" and put in place a baseline level of security (two-factor authentication) around internet-facing assets such as web servers.</p>
<p>Second, research universities are more likely than K-12 school systems to be targets of cyber-espionage. But that doesn't mean school districts aren't targets themselves. The bad guys seem to go after personally identifying information on students just as much as they do cutting-edge research.</p>
<p>Third, don't forget the basics. Phishing, general e-mail security, ransomware and DoS continue to threaten education. Make sure they're addressed. "These topics may not seem new, but we still have not learned our lesson," the report noted.</p>
