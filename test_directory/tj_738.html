<p>The market for mobile computing devices in K-12 worldwide  has grown by 18 percent, according to new analysis by <a href="http://www.futuresource-consulting.com/" target="_blank">Futuresource Consulting</a>.  That equates to 5.7 million devices being shipped in the fourth quarter of  2014.</p>
<p>But that growth pales in comparison to numbers in the United  States, where the market grew by 40.5 percent in 2014, driven, according to the  research firm, by Common Core and the broad adoption of online assessments.<br/>

<p>Futuresource monitors national-level projects in as many as  46 countries globally. In its recent market track report for personal computing  in K-12 the firm highlighted how governments are increasingly realizing that  they can influence the skill sets of their future workforce through major technology  investment programs in schools.</p>
<p>Chromebooks, which run <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a> as their operating  system, garnered 39 percent of market share in the United States last year with  three million units sold. That was good enough to overtake <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad/" target="_blank">Apple's iPad</a> as the best-selling device;  iPads pulled in 26 percent of sales.</p>

<p>Mike Fisher, ‎associate director of education technology  noted in a statement that while his company has seen "strong success"  for Chromebooks in this country, they've had "limited success" out of  the United States. "Apple continues to maintain a strong position in  developed markets, especially in Western Europe," he added.</p>
<p>Many Microsoft partners are offering detachable and  convertible form factors, which are slowly gaining traction and are expected to  gain share in 2015. Those include models from <a href="http://www.lenovo.com/us/en/" target="_blank">Lenovo</a>, <a href="http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/home" target="_blank">Acer</a>, <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/home.html" target="_blank">HP</a> and <a href="http://www.asus.com/US/" target="_blank">Asus</a>. "In terms of actual numbers, the  adoption of these to data is quite low, but we expect this to increase," said  Market Analyst Phillip Maddocks.</p>
<p>Futuresource predicted that growth in PC adoption would  continue, although at a slower pace. The company projected 12 percent growth in  2015 worldwide and 10 percent in the United States.</p>
