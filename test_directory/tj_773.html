<p><a href="http://www.curriculumassociates.com/" target="_blank">Curriculum  Associates</a> has launched a free new educational math game app for the iPad, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/door-24-plus/id950043113?mt=8" target="_blank">Door 24  Plus</a>.</p>
<p>An expansion of the company's Door 24 app, "Door 24  Plus establishes a foundation based on fact fluency and then builds  computational fluency by providing practice that requires students to solve  problems using basic facts, number sense and algebraic thinking,"  according to a news release.</p>
<p>An assessment designed to identify skill gaps and areas in  need of growth assigns students to one of two games most appropriate for them.</p>
<p>In Snargg and Splatt, designed to help develop fact fluency,  students fight against the "Snargg-nado" by completing math facts and  throwing balls. Featuring an optional two-player mode, "The game develops automaticity with basic math  facts in all four operations and provides repeated exposure to math facts via  spiral review," according to information released by Curriculum  Associates.</p>

<p>The second game,  Victor Fixer, focuses on computational fluency by asking students to help Victor,  a malfunctioning robot, get back into working order by solving equations  equivalent to 24. Victor Fixer also features a two-player mode. </p>
