<p>Despite all the headlines and conference coverage of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) for education over the last year, the technology is still gaining speed — residing at that sweet spot in the hype cycle where, when you place headsets on people and gently guide them to turn around to gain a full view, they tend to gasp and say, "Oh, wow." So imagine how your students would respond if, in that next geography lesson, instead of handing them a flat map of Peru, you pass out pre-loaded smartphones to each table along with a $15<a href="https://store.google.com/category/virtual_reality"> Google Cardboard</a> and ask them to pull up a walking tour that places them in Machu Picchu. </p>
<p>"Seeing is believing," said Colin Messenger, a senior market analyst with a focus on education at<a href="http://www.futuresource-consulting.com/"> FutureSource Consulting</a>. Even if the viewing lasts just two minutes with each student, he added, "that's long enough" for the experience to stick. </p>

<p>However, anybody who has watched the education segment for any length of time also knows that the initial "cool" factor isn't enough to sustain the market. Last year's<a href="http://cdn.nmc.org/media/2016-nmc-cosn-horizon-report-k12-EN.pdf"> NMC/CoSN Horizon Report on K-12 education</a> gave VR two to three years to hit the tipping point. As a recent<a href="http://www.futuresource-consulting.com/Futuresource-BETT-2017-Show-Report-Download.html"> FutureSource report</a> noted, a big question is whether this new technology can be integrated deeply enough into the curriculum and help achieve specific learning outcomes in order to drive mainstream adoption.</p>
<div class="sidebarhalf" type="SideBarContent">
<h3>What are VR and AR?</h3>
<p>When Discovery Education's Hall Davidson speaks about VR and AR at education conferences, he defines VR as computer-generated reality that puts the viewer in a place that can be real or unreal — "real, meaning you're in the Louvre, or unreal, meaning you're on an imaginary space station outside Saturn." AR is when a layer is placed "on top of reality as an augmentation of reality." He points to the use of AR in NFL games on TV. "There's not really a yellow line that goes across the field showing the first down marker, but it enhances your viewing. It makes it more understandable and adds information that helps you learn that game."</p>

<p><strong>Virtual Results with Staying Power </strong></p>
<p>What will that take? User pull is one component, suggested FutureSource. Teachers need to be clamoring; otherwise, it'll continue to be a product in search of a market. Practically speaking, if VR and AR require "onsite demonstrations" to make sales, the channel that typically sells into education will struggle to maintain margins for these kinds of products. What they want to identify is reoccurring revenue. It will be like the early days of classroom computing, when schools could barely justify purchasing laptops for teachers. Only when large purchase orders were on the table for outfitting whole classrooms or grades did the K–12 market suddenly command real attention among device makers, forcing pricing down. Right now, just a few vendors such as<a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/clp/googleexpeditions/pcmcat748302046351.c?id=pcmcat748302046351"> BestBuy</a> and<a href="https://nearpod.com/nearpod-vr"> NearPod</a> have developed kits that include everything a teacher might need to use VR in the classroom. These are expensive; a 10-student kit from BestBuy is $3,999; a 30-student kit is $9,999. </p>
<p>Another aspect needed to ensure success of VR is an ample supply of education-tailored content. This is an area where a number of companies are jumping into the opportunity. Google, for example, has worked with hundreds of partners to produce<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uwWvAzAiQDueKXkxvqF6rS84oae2AU7eD8bhxzJ9SdY/edit#gid=0"> more than 500</a> separate<a href="https://edu.google.com/expeditions/"> Expeditions</a>, group VR experiences that have a "guide" who leads and "explorers" who follow. Users plunge into these immersive environments using the low-cost Cardboard viewer powered by a smartphone that can run the Cardboard app. Google helpmate<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzuqhhs6NWbgTzMuM09WKDQ/videos"> YouTube</a> has nearly 300 VR videos posted on its site, though they're just as likely to be non-education oriented (such as, "Sunsets for Sale — the first Virtual Reality Infomercial!"). </p>
