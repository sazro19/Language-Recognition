<p>Previously, the school was using  a paper-based system that was awkward and difficult to update once printed. The  school decided to adopts <a href="https://www.schooldude.com/" target="_blank">SchoolDude's</a> <a href="https://www.schooldude.com/solutions/products/crisismanager" target="_blank">CrisisManager</a>.</p>
<p>With the app, staff at the grade  6-12 college prep school can now access customizable response plans, with or  without a Wi-Fi connection, that can be updated in real time and restricted by  organizational role. Plans include building diagrams and one-touch emergency  contact calling. Staff can also create incident reports with images and GPS  location data.</p>

<p>"With more than 700 students on a 55-acre campus,  we needed a way to empower our staff with the most up-to-date safety  procedures," said Patrick Roberts, head of school at Palmer Trinity School,  in a prepared statement. "Booklets and binders are no longer effective. Working  with Gus Sabogal in our technology department, we realized that CrisisManager  helps us create a safer teaching and learning environment by guaranteeing that  emergency plans are quickly available on our staff's mobile devices."</p>
<p>The school plans to make a future version of  the app available to students and parents.</p>
