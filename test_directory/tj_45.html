<p>Now
that <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/5g-iphone-12-and-12-pro-apple-announces-new-phone-lineup-superfast-speeds/">Apple</a>
has joined Samsung in bringing 5G to the masses with its recent
release of new phones, it's time to look past what has long been
called a game-changing technology to what's next — 10G. A <a href="https://www.10gplatform.com/sites/default/files/TAS_10G_FINAL.pdf">new
report on 10G networks</a>
laid out the economic benefits, including "the emergence of more
secure, lower latency broadband connections with dramatically faster
speeds that eventually will be capable of delivering near symmetrical
download and upload speeds of up to 10 Gbps."</p>
<p>Announced
in January 2019 by the broadband industry, 10G offers the promise of
delivering 10 times the current most prevalent maximum speeds offered
to consumers. In August, according to <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/united-states#fixed">Speedtest's
Global Index</a>,
Americans had an average download speed of 157 megabits per second
and an upload speed of 59 Mbps on fixed broadband. The average for
mobile networks download was 45 Mbps and upload was 10 Mbps. 10G also
comes with a latency of 1
millisecond, compared to the current peak average of 17ms for fixed
broadband. That level of latency is "critical," the report
noted, for applications in the Internet of Things and ehealth,
categories of technology where "timeliness is important."</p>

<p>How
will the world get there? By extending the use of fiber. As the
report noted, "the deeper fiber is deployed in the cable
network," the lower the number of households supported by the
cable side of the network set-up, thereby increasing the capacity
available to each user. For their part cable operators will need to
install additional equipment and upgrade other gear to achieve more
capacity on the fiber link, and customers will need to run new
set-top boxes or adapters to get the new speeds.</p>
<p>The
report lays out an argument for how the increase in fixed bandwidth
will benefit national economic growth by nearly $330 billion between
the years 2021 and 2027. For one, there's the $127 billion boost
created by the spending on 10G development itself, measured to be
376,000 "job years" over the seven-year span, in
construction, electronic equipment, manufacturing and related
industries. There's an additional $132 billion in cumulative gross
domestic product and 300,000 jobs from "spillovers" created
by the increase in network speed, and another $71.5 billion in
consumer spending for entertaining and information applications.</p>
<p>Then
there's the enablement of new applications and use cases, heralding
what is being termed the "fourth industrial revolution."
Many of these touch on technologies that currently only play on the
fringes of education. Massively multiplayer online gaming, with its
demands for high bandwidth coupled with low latency, will be a
beneficiary of 10G, the report explained, along with immersive video
and 8K streaming and virtual, augmented and holographic reality. As
an example of the potential, the report's experts portended the
arrival of virtual lecture halls where instructors teach dozens or
hundreds of students who are seeing and interacting simultaneously in
a much more immersive experience than current standards deliver.</p>
<p>Developed
by <a href="https://www.ncta.com/">the
Internet &amp; Television Association</a>
(NCTA) and <a href="http://www.teleadvs.com/">Telecom
Advisory Services</a>,
the report doesn't disguise its real agenda: making sure policymakers
and lawmakers encourage 10G development through tax exemptions,
reductions or eliminations of fees, support for specific WiFi
policies, and avoiding policies that could delay the build-out of
10G.</p>
<p>The
report is openly available <a href="https://www.10gplatform.com/sites/default/files/TAS_10G_FINAL.pdf">on
a dedicated 10G platform website</a>.</p>
