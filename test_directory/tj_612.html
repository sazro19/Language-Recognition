<h3>Top 3 Favorite Technologies</h3>
<p>
As part of our first annual Readers' Choice Awards, we wanted to find out which technologies educators use and like the most. So our survey included an open-ended question: Among all of the technologies you're currently using, which ones are your favorites?</p>
<p>Voters picked gadgets as their top three choices and, in spite of research suggesting a decline in shipments, iPads are still among educators' favorites. And it turned out that the sometimes-maligned interactive whiteboard actually topped the list.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Interactive whiteboards and whiteboard software</strong>: Smart, specifically, was the brand most mentioned by name.</li>
<li><strong>Tablets</strong>: Apple's iPad was the top brand and model mentioned by name.</li>
<li><strong>Laptops</strong>: Google Chromebooks were referenced more than any other brand or device.</li>
</ol>

<p>At this moment in education you're probably surrounded by technology that is intended to help you teach, learn, manage, record, compute, coach, present, protect and alert. And there's more coming all the time. When you know there's got to be hardware or software out there that will save you time, help you do a better job and, most importantly, improve the chances that your students are engaged and learning, how do you pick? Chances are, you look to your peers. So that's exactly what we've done.</p>
<p>For our first-ever pre-K–12 Readers' Choice Awards, THE Journal got hundreds of education professionals to tell us which products they choose in more than 30 different categories. Broadly, we cover classroom software and hardware, devices, and school and district products. In almost every category you'll find Platinum, Gold and Silver picks from your colleagues. Congratulations to the winners, and we hope this list helps you narrow down your shopping options — and maybe spurs some debate.</p>
<h5>Classroom Software</h5>
<p><strong>Learning Management <br/>
and E-Learning</strong><br/>
Platinum pick Google Classroom came on the scene in August 2014. Since then, this free learning management system has swept through the category. As one ed tech evangelist and teacher noted after trying it out, "Watch out, high-priced LMSes." </p>

<p> Platinum: Google Classroom</p>
</div>
<p>Gold medalist Edmodo, which provides a free LMS for class collaboration, launched a marketplace for learning resources earlier this year. Blackboard Learn, the silver pick for K-12, is getting a major do-over in what the company is calling the "New Learning Experience," announced at this summer's BbWorld user conference.</p>
<ul>
<li> Platinum: Google Classroom</li>
<li>Gold: Edmodo</li>
<li>Silver: Blackboard Learn</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Office Productivity</strong></p>
<div class="calloutImgRight" type="CallOut">
<img alt="Microsoft Office" height="260" src="/-/media/EDU/THEJournal/Images/2015/09/2office.jpg" width="519"/>
<p>Platinum: Microsoft Office/Office 365</p>
</div>

This hotly contested product area saw Microsoft Office as the leader with Google Apps for Education hot on its heels. Both offer free editions for education, and no other vendors' programs come close. However, Apple's own productivity software still got some love among Mac and iOS fans.


<ul>
<li> Platinum: Microsoft Office/Office 365</li>
<li>Gold: Google Apps</li>
<li>Silver: Apple Productivity Apps (previously iWork)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Classroom Presentation</strong></p>
<p>PowerPoint was the clear winner in this category followed by a pair of free online programs.</p>
