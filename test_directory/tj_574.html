<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>1. Download and install the latest Wintab driver from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49498" target="_blank">Microsoft's site here</a>.</p>
<p>2. Reboot, then launch your graphics app.    </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Photoshop</strong>: Pick a brush that uses pressure sensitivity, and start drawing.</li>
<li><strong>GIMP</strong>: Go to Edit &gt; Input Devices.    <br/>
    • Select "Microsoft device Stylus."<br/>
    • Set the mode to "Screen."<br/>
    • Pick a brush that uses pressure sensitivity, and start drawing.<br/>

<p>The single greatest advantage of Microsoft's high-end Surface Pro 4 tablet over other high-end mobile Windows devices is its pressure-sensitive stylus. So those of you who jumped in with the latest generation of the device may have been perplexed (as I was) to find that some of the most popular graphics apps out there —  including older versions of Photoshop (CS6) and even the open source GIMP — were incapable of using  stylus pressure ... even though they worked just dandily on the Surface Pro 3.</p>

<p>Almost as perplexing was the lack of a workaround to the problem — at least as far as I could find — from Microsoft, Adobe or the Internet in general. </p>
<p>But the workaround is actually quite simple — and even official. It's just very, very poorly documented.</p>
<p>The one thing you need in order to make both Photoshop and GIMP work with the Surface Pro 4's pressure-sensitive stylus is the latest Wintab driver from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Download and install it from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49498" target="_blank">Microsoft's site here</a>.</p>
<p>Expand the "Details" button to see what's available. Click the Download button to choose which of the files you want to install.</p>
<div class="imageCap fullWidth"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49498" target="_blank"><img alt="surface pro 4 pressure sensitivity photoshop workaround" height="426" src="/-/media/EDU/THEJournal/Images/2016/01/20160110surface1.jpg" width="644"/></a>
</div>
<p>Check the option for Wintab_x64_1.0.0.20.zip (or whatever the latest version is when you read this). You can also, alternately, choose to download and install all of the driver updates contained in the other packages.</p>
<div class="imageCap fullWidth"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49498" target="_blank"><img alt="photoshop cs6 pressure sensitive stylus surface pro 4" height="254" src="/-/media/EDU/THEJournal/Images/2016/01/20160110surface2.jpg" width="644"/></a>
</div>
<p>Once it downloads, expand the zip file, then run the WinTab_Setup_x64 application, following all of the onscreen instructions.</p>
<p>Go through the install process, then reboot and launch Photoshop (CS6 in my case). There are no further steps required for Photoshop. Et voila! Pressure sensitivity abounds!</p>

</div>
<p>In GIMP, there are additional steps required. Go to Edit &gt; Input Devices to open the Configure Input Devices dialog. In the list on the left, select "Microsoft device Stylus," and set the Mode to "Screen" (as pictured). </p>

</div>
<p>You may also adjust the pressure curve to your liking, but in the current version of the software there doesn't seem to be much of an effect either way. </p>

</div>
<p>It's also worth noting that pressure sensitivity in GIMP is still a little wonky, as it doesn't seem to register full pressure at this time with some brushes.</p>
