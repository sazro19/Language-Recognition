<p>Advocacy group <a href="http://www.educationsuperhighway.org/" target="_blank">EducationSuperHighway</a> is refuting claims made by the <a href="https://www.aasa.org/Default.aspx" target="_blank">School Superintendents Association</a> (AASA) and the <a href="http://www.aesa.us/" target="_blank">Association of Educational Service Agencies</a> (AESA) that its data collection initiative might be detrimental to districts' E-rate applications. The two groups <a href="https://www.aasa.org/aasablog.aspx?id=32558&amp;blogid=286" target="_blank">warned members yesterday</a> that use of ESH's <a href="http://www.educationsuperhighway.org/submit-your-data.html" target="_blank">Item 21 Portal</a> might slow down the processing of their applications or make use of private data in unforeseen ways.</p>
<p>EducationSuperHighway is a nonprofit organization devoted to ensuring "that every K-12 public school in America has the Internet infrastructure that students and teachers need for digital learning," according to their <a href="http://www.educationsuperhighway.org/about-us.html" target="_blank">mission statement</a>.</p>

<p>One tool the organization has deployed to that end is the Item 21 Portal, which asks districts submitting E-rate applications to give ESH copies of their <a href="http://www.usac.org/sl/applicants/step04/item-21.aspx" target="_blank">Item 21</a> files describing their Internet pricing. Once a district submits the files to ESH, they can then email them to themselves to receive a PDF to submit to the <a href="http://www.usac.org/default.aspx" target="_blank">Universal Service Administrative Company</a> (USAC) along with the rest of their application. </p>
<p><strong>Will the Portal Slow Down E-rate Applications?</strong><br/>
In a Q&amp;A written to inform members about the portal, AASA Executive Director Daniel Domenech and AESA Executive Director Lee Warne wrote that "after the Item 21 Portal PDF is submitted by the applicant, the ESH Item 21 data will be processed in the same manner as a paper submission, not an online submission. It takes time for USAC to process, match and upload non-online Item 21 attachments. This is time that ultimately delays the issuance of Funding Commitment Decision Letters."</p>
<p>"In fact that's absolutely not the case," said ESH CEO and Founder Evan Marwell. "USAC does not have a policy that people who file using their online tool get their applications reviewed before people who file with any other manner that they accept and in fact the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) and the chairman have said that they're very focused on making sure everybody's applications get processed in a rapid way this year, no matter how they filed."<br/>
<br/>
"USAC may have to do a little bit of extra data entry if somebody files using a PDF from the Item 21 Portal, but we've actually offered to provide USAC that data in electronic form so they don't even have to do that," added Marwell.</p>
<p><strong>How Will Data Collected by the Portal Be Used?</strong><br/>
"Participation in the ESH Item 21 Portal represents an E-Rate applicant submitting information to a private group, and that gives us and our members concern," wrote Domenech and Warne. "We are hopeful that ESH will provide written assurances to clarify how they intend to use the portal information, who will ‘own’ the data, what privacy policies guide their use of the data and how those privacy policies coordinate with existing local, state and federal privacy policies." </p>
<p>Marwell said that a written policy will be posted to the ESH site soon, "and essentially what that says is that EducationSuperHighway will use the information to publish aggregate reports at the national, state and regional level that sort of summarize the key learnings from the information. That we will provide government agencies, including the FCC the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/" target="_blank">United States Department of Education</a>, states and intermediate units, with the specific data that we gather from districts and libraries within their jurisdiction…and that we will give districts and libraries access to both that aggregate information, but also to anonymized detailed information in their region. So we won't actually disclose any district's name unless that district has given us permission to do so." </p>
