<p>A non-profit organization with technology that brings  digital content to "offline" populations around the world for the  purposes of education will be paying more attention to a U.S. population that's  also unable to access the Internet: those in prisons and jails. <a href="http://worldpossible.org/" target="_blank">World Possible</a>, which has drawn an  international team of volunteers to support people in Kenya, Namibia, Guatemala  and Sierra Leone, has received a $250,000 donation from an unnamed source to develop  a U.S.-based prison education technology pilot program.</p>
<p>The project will expand the use of <a href="https://racheloffline.org/collections/frontpage/products/rachel-plus" target="_blank">RACHEL-Plus</a> (for "Remote Area Community Hotspot for Education and Learning"), a  technology developed by the organization that combines a collection of websites  with an <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/education/products/content-access-point.html" target="_blank">Intel  Education Content Access Point (CAP)</a>. The CAP creates a wireless hotspot in  a setting with no Internet connectivity to give browser-based content access to  the user.</p>

<p>The prison education program will be run by Frank Martin, who  formerly handled education administration for the Oregon Youth Authority.</p>
<p>"The incarcerated populations in the United States are  not being given adequate 21st century skills they need to re-enter society. By  leveraging current open-source collections of content and unique offline  technologies, we're bringing educational opportunities into a place that was  off limits just a few short years ago," Martin said, in a news release. "If  we prepare inmates — and I prefer the term students — for re-entry by equipping  them with appropriate digital skills, access to education, and career content,  we are going to reduce recidivism and unlock the potential that is in each of  these returning citizens."</p>
