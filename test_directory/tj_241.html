<p><a href="https://herok12.com/" target="_blank">Hero K12</a> wants to support the full journey of a student throughout school. Today, the Florida-based company revealed it has received $150 million in equity investment funding to acquire other education technology companies and to continue building a data-driven platform that helps foster a positive school culture. </p>
<p>Hero’s SaaS (software as a service) platform offers schools student behavior tracking and referral management. Teachers and administrators can use the platform to promote a positive school culture by reinforcing good behavior with rewards. They receive reports that enable them to intervene when necessary. If a student is late for class, for example, teachers will be able to scan the student's ID card to issue a digital tardy pass and notify the student's parents. </p>
<p>The company received more than $150 million from Boston-based <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=BV+Investment+Partners&amp;oq=BV+Investment+Partners&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.542j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">BV Investment Partners</a> to boost its acquisition capacity, according to a company <a href="https://herok12.com/blog/hero-k12-announces-equity-partner" target="_blank">announcement</a>. </p>
