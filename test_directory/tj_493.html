<p>As part of our work for the <a href="https://www.graphite.org/privacy" target="_blank">Common  Sense District Privacy Evaluation Initiative</a>, we spend a lot of time  reading through the text of privacy policies and terms of service of  educational software. However, we are also looking at the mechanics of how  these policies are articulated and delivered. Over time, as we evaluate more  policies, we will be looking for possible patterns or correlations between  technical and stylistic details, and the contents of policies. </p>
<p>To be clear, we do not think we will find any direct  correlation between policy structures and whether terms are good or bad (although  if we could see that predictably, that would make everyone's life a whole lot  easier). However, even based on what we've seen so far — and we are in the  early stages of this analytical work — we are seeing some potential indicators  that will help us highlight specific elements of policies and analyze them more  efficiently. To get a better sense of our process and how we're carrying out  this work, I've outlined a few of the primary ways we are analyzing privacy  policies here.</p>

<p><strong>Reading Level</strong><br/>
We run a high-level textual analysis of each policy and  calculate reading levels using six openly documented formulas: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index" target="_blank">Automated Readability index</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman%E2%80%93Liau_index" target="_blank">Coleman–Liau index</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests" target="_blank">Flesch–Kincaid grade level</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests" target="_blank">Flesch reading ease</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning_fog_index" target="_blank">Gunning  Fog index</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smog" target="_blank">SMOG</a>. By using multiple measures, we can  cross-reference reading levels across policies in cases where we see one method  registering as an outlier. Doing an initial assessment of reading levels will  also allow us to compare the audience of a specific application with the  reading level for the terms. For example, it will be interesting to see how  many applications designed for middle schoolers have terms at a middle school  level compared to a college or graduate school reading level.</p>
<p><strong>Structure and  Accessibility</strong><br/>
Next, we do some analysis of how the terms are structured.  To do this, we grab a full copy of all the text used to render the page (i.e.,  the <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/View-Source-Code" target="_blank">full  source code</a> of the page). Then, we strip it down to the actual text  displayed on the page and calculate how much of the page is actual content.  This calculation gives us a quick glimpse into how cleanly a page has been  built, which in turn allows us to make some assumptions about potential  usability or <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag" target="_blank">accessibility</a> issues. We have seen some cases  where over 97 percent of a page was markup and less than 3 percent of a page  was actual content. Issues like this also provide an initial glimpse into  potential technical issues within an application.</p>
<p>These calculations have also led us to see some other  peculiarities in how privacy policies have been constructed. For example, we  have seen privacy policies buried in markup that implies the privacy policy is  an <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_form.asp" target="_blank">interactive form</a>. We have also seen policies buried in the  footers of web pages; to a user with a screen reader, that policy is somewhere  between difficult and impossible to find. While these policies can potentially  do a good job protecting content, when the basics of HTML get ignored, it  raises questions about the attention to detail given to the actual product.</p>
