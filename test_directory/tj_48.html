<p><a href="https://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a>
has introduced updates to its flagship virtual desktop infrastructure
(VDI) platform with the introduction of <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/euc/2020/08/vmware-horizon-8.html">Horizon
8</a>, as
well as new additions to its <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workspace-one.html">VMware
Workspace ONE</a>,
its digital workspace platform.</p>
<p>VMware
Horizon 8 is designed to help IT organizations more efficiently
manage and scale virtual desktop and application delivery across
public and private clouds from a single control panel. The company
said that new capabilities would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More
    hybrid and multi-cloud deployment options, covering Google Cloud
    VMware Engine, Horizon on VMware Cloud on Dell EMC and Horizon on
    Azure VMware Solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New
    instant clone capabilities previously only available in pricier
    editions of Horizon 7. This kind of provisioning helps IT directly
    provision "instant" clones without requiring a parent
    virtual machine, thereby freeing up memory resources and increasing
    the number of desktops possible per host, reducing costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New
    RESTful APIs, to help IT in automating capabilities of Horizon 8,
    including monitoring, entitlements, and user and machine management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimized
    support for Microsoft Teams video and audio, and continued support
    for Zoom and Cisco WebEx, to deliver a better user experience from
    virtual desktops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The
    ability to publish Linux applications directly from a Linux server
    in the Horizon platform, reducing the costs associated with licenses
    from other operating systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The
company said that Horizon 8 would help IT "deliver more secure
virtual workspaces," by letting them establish and verify end
user identity with built-in multi-factor authentication and enabling
conditional access policies for virtual desktops and applications.</p>
<p>IDC
Research Manager Shannon Kalvar said in a press release that
"unifying physical device management (including PCs, Chromebooks
and phones), digital workspace creation/operations and client
workspace security into the overall platform is an attractive
proposition for customers that are already invested in it."</p>
<p>At
<a href="http://www.west-windsor-plainsboro.k12.nj.us/">West
Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District</a>
in New Jersey, which is using VMware Horizon for virtual desktops for
remote learning, students, faculty and staff can get "the same
experience at home as they would have on site," said Harry
Doctor, technology manager. "In response to COVID-19, it was
crucial to support 1:1 computing with Chromebooks for every student
in grades 5-12," he noted. "With Horizon, we’re able to
keep students engaged with a robust array of teaching and learning
tools that would be difficult to access using Chromebooks alone."</p>
