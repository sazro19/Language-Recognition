<p>A girl who knows how to code can change the world.</p>
<p>At least, that’s what Markie Wagner of Whittier, CA thinks. She’s a soon-to-be senior at <a href="http://www.wuhsd.org/lshs" target="_blank">La Serna High School</a> in Whittier, and she believes all girls should try their hand at computer science. Her efforts and enthusiasm have inspired her school to launch two new STEM classes in the fall — Intro to Engineering and Advanced Placement Computer Science.</p>
<p>“That was very exciting to hear,” said Wagner, who recently finished a computer coding immersion program at UCLA. Last summer, she participated in an eight-week program offered by <a href="https://girlswhocode.com" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a>, a nationally respected nonprofit organization that aims to close the gender gap in technology education and the industry. </p>
<p>“It’s important for girls to get into computer science because there are so many boys in computer science,” said Wagner, 16. She turns 17 Aug. 1. “Right now, we’re getting ideas and technology from half the population. There are so many ideas, so many different perspectives that girls can come up with that boys didn’t think of.”</p>

<p>Wagner’s passion for computers and how they work started early. As a 9-year-old, she loved playing <a href="http://www.clubpenguin.com" target="_blank">Club Penguin</a>, a massively multiplayer online game created by <a href="http://clubpenguin.wikia.com/wiki/New_Horizon_Interactive" target="_blank">New Horizon Interactive</a> (now known as Walt Disney Online Studios Canada) where the player can make his or her own little penguin avatar, explore different maps and scenarios and live in its own penguin world.</p>
<p>“I learned to change the way my websites looked and to use different web languages,” she said. “I learned HTML and CSS and made a website about my hamster. Then I created a site that sold eco-friendly products.”</p>
<p>By 13, she got into app programming. She created a free Android phone app based on the Hasbro game Catch Phrase that was downloaded 28,000 times. She didn’t know about trademarks then. But now, she’s reworking the app to comply with brand rules before making it available for iOS.</p>
<p>Last year, Wagner participated in a summer immersion program organized by Girls Who Code. It was at the <a href="http://bhtechyouthcenter.wix.com/bhtyc" target="_blank">Boyle Heights Technology YouthSource Center</a> in Los Angeles. During the program, she learned a ton about coding and also met senior engineers at JPL, the chief technology officer at Walt Disney Studios, executives at AT&amp;T and the mayor of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>“Connections are so valuable, and networking is so important,” Wagner said. “I don’t know where I’d be without Girls Who Code.” </p>
<p>Wagner was eager to teach children about computers after finishing the Girls Who Code program. Last September, she was invited to tutor and mentor fifth graders on coding and robotics at the <a href="https://32ndstreet-uscmagnet.schoolloop.com" target="_blank">32nd Street USC Magnet Elementary School</a>. </p>
<p>“There aren’t as many women role models in the tech industry,” she said. “There aren’t very many women’s names among the big names in tech. One of my life aspirations is to be one of those names. Someone whom girls can look up to. She did it, so I can do it too.” </p>
<p>La Serna High Principal Ann Fitzgerald was impressed with Wagner’s passion for coding and computers. She talked to Markie, who was starting a computer coding club on campus, and the two agreed that the school needed formal classes to teach all students about computers, engineering and technology.</p>
