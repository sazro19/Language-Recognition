<p>The <a href="http://www.setda.org/" target="_blank">State Educational  Technology Directors Association</a> (SETDA) and <a href="https://www.ena.com/" target="_blank">Education  Networks of America</a> (ENA) have released <a href="http://www.setda.org/master/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/StateWiFiLeadership_Final_91917.pdf" target="_blank">a  new report</a> examining the steps states are taking to close the gaps in  wireless access between their schools and districts.</p>
<p>The report offers four recommendations for policy  makers and school leaders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase infrastructure to support  student-centered learning;</li>
<li>Design infrastructure to meet capacity targets;</li>
<li>Ensure equity of access for all students outside  of school; and</li>
<li>Leverage state resources to increase broadband  access.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report also looks at policy, planning, funding  and management approaches to WiFi in Illinois, New Mexico, North Carolina and  Utah.</p>

<p>Before concluding, the report's authors offer a  10-point checklist of recommendations for broadband access planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include WiFi in the planning process;</li>
<li>Establish a standard for what constitutes WiFi  that is ready for digital learning;</li>
<li>Support a funding model;</li>
<li>Create guidelines for pricing and an approved  vendor qualification form;</li>
<li>Share best practices and engineering expertise  from vendors and other partners;</li>
<li>Foster a statewide professional learning community;</li>
<li>Engage the state legislature;</li>
<li>Monitor internal broadband growth and usage  throughout the state;</li>
<li>Establish a team to help schools address the  homework gap; and</li>
<li>Assist schools in planning and preparing for  today and the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>"States play a critical role in promoting the  availability of equitable internal broadband access among their schools,"  the report's authors write in conclusion. "As the four case studies  demonstrate, various approaches can be implemented by state leadership teams to  assist the K–12 community with this critical issue. What’s important to  remember is, while there are multiple pathways to providing students with  high-quality WiFi in a sustainable and scalable manner, the ultimate focus  should always remain on the teaching and learning."</p>
