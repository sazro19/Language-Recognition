<p><a href="http://www.harrisschoolsolutions.com/" target="_blank">Harris School Solutions</a> has integrated an online payment portal for parents, eSchoolPayments, into its <a href="http://www.harrisschoolsolutions.com/en/solutions/harris_financial_solutions/aaweb/" target="_blank">Activities Account Web</a> (AAWeb) platform for managing school funds and transactions.</p>
<p>As a result of the integration, districts will be able to collect fees via credit cards without storing information. Payment information will be automatically provided to general ledger and cash accounts. Parents will be able to pay fees from any Internet-connected device, eliminating the need to send checks or cash to school.</p>
<p>AAWeb is designed to simplify processes for tracking and reconciling activity funds such as club and athletic events and, with the eSchoolPayments integration, to automate manual entry.</p>
<p>"We are very excited to announce the roll-out of our online payment portal," said Deana Kovalcik, vice president of sales at Harris School Financial Solutions, in a prepared statement. "Parents will now be able to log in, view fees due, and make a payment from the convenience of their own home for all of their kids whether or not they attend the same school within a district. As a parent, I know this is a feature families will appreciate."</p>
