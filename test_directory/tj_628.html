<p><a href="https://www.lawtonps.org/" target="_blank">Lawton Public Schools</a>
(LPS) in Lawton, OK, has picked a
new student information system (SIS) to replace one that was nearing
the end of
its functionality.</p>
<p>Lawton
is the eighth school district in Oklahoma
to pick <a href="https://www.infinitecampus.com/products/district-edition" target="_blank">Infinite
Campus' District Edition</a> for its SIS. Lawton district

Specialist David Erwin said Oklahoma state compliance rules are
particularly
difficult to manage and Infinite Campus seems to be one that
corresponds well
with the state-mandated demands.</p>
<p>"Based
on our review of error reports across all
Oklahoma school districts, Infinite Campus is the best SIS for data
validation,
in addition to being a state-approved vendor," Erwin said.</p>
<p>The 25-campus district also hopes
to streamline processes.</p>
<p>"We
will be able to skip scheduled data exchanges
across systems and eliminate two-day delays concerning reports, grade
books and
student-parent portals," said Erwin.</p>
<p>The
new system, which will go live in the summer
of 2016, will give educators and administrators in the 15,000-student
district
real-time access to information almost anywhere and at any time. LPS
administrators said they are looking forward to a centralized database
that can
be used as a district-wide repository of data that will help with
data-driven
decision-making.</p>
