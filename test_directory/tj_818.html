<p>A
new version of the PingPong classroom response system
is designed to allow
teachers to make better use of the notes they take on the system, log in
for
use in a specific classroom and use more display options.</p>
<p>With
the
existing PingPong "clicker," teachers can ask students questions that
can
then be answered on their own mobile devices (with a mobile app) in
several
ways, including multiple choice, true/false or with short selected
answers. The
accumulated responses can then be displayed in graph form on a screen at
the
front of the classroom.</p>
<p>Updates
to the apps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A
    firmer
    integration with <a href="https://www.evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote</a> that will allow teachers to share, highlight and
    review with students the notes that they make. They can also save
    classroom
    activities on Evernote for use or reference at a later time.</li>
<li>A
    GPS that
    allows teachers and students to use the app in multiple classrooms
    without
    having to use a room code to log in each time they move from location to
    location.</li>
<li>A
    wider
    variety of display options beyond the previous circle graphs, including
    bar
    graphs and thumbnails.</li>
<li>A
    Quick Menu
    that will allow users to make adjustments to how they display content on
    the
    screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Made
by <a href="www.waterbear.co.kr" target="_blank">Waterbear Soft</a>, the
company's founder, Young-ji Ma, said the upgrades were
in response to feedback from teachers who have used PingPong.</p>
<p>"We
put
our heads together to come up with ways to help students become more
creative, inquisitive and better at solving problems," Ma
said.</p>
<p>PingPong
already
offered a timer function, the ability for the teacher to randomly
select students to present their content on a screen at the front of the
room,
and a feature to pick winners of contests.</p>
<p>The
PingPong
app is available at no cost in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pingpong-smart-clickers-to/id734147693?mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kr.co.waterbear.pingpong" target="_blank">Play</a> stores.</p>
