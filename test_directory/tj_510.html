<p>I  began my education career right out of college in the fall of 1992. My first  teaching job was at Brewster Academy, a small boarding school in central New  Hampshire. That year, the school began planning efforts that led to one of the  nation's first 1-to-1 learning programs.  Little did I know that, only a decade later, I'd  be working in a small gray office cubicle in the Maine Department of Education,  helping lead the nation's first statewide  1-to-1 learning program: the Maine Learning Technology Initiative (MLTI). </p>
<p>One  of my responsibilities as Maine's  coordinator of education technology was buying the technology and associated  services for the MLTI. To say that I've been  responsible for buying a lot of computers (and tablets) is an understatement.  It's from this perspective that I share some  thoughts about the selection and purchasing of students'  primary learning devices.</p>

<p><strong>Choosing a  Purchasing Model: BYOD vs. District-Purchased Devices</strong><br/>
There  are generally two purchasing models: The district pays, or families pay (bring  your own device/BYOD). In some instances, I've  seen a cost-sharing model. </p>
<p><strong>BYOD</strong> has its  supporters and opponents. On page 72 of the <a href="http://tech.ed.gov/netp/" target="_blank">2016 National Education Technology Plan  (NETP)</a>,  the U.S. Department of Education shares some issues for districts to consider  when looking at BYOD, including three key concerns: </p>
<ol>
<li>Economic disparity</li>
<li>Instructional burden, and </li>
<li>Privacy and security. </li>
</ol>
<p>Many  BYOD programs have attempted to mitigate economic disparity by budgeting  district funds to buy devices for families that qualify for free and reduced  lunch. However, I argue that doing so can jeopardize student privacy and  security. By using district funds to buy devices for these families, the  district makes visible which students have means and which do not. Districts  should seriously consider whether this practice violates student privacy.</p>
<p>Another  option, <strong>a district-purchased device for  all students</strong>, also has its challenges, but I believe those are outweighed  by the benefits. Economically, a BYOD program means less spending by the  district because spending has been shifted to the family. However, the  district-purchased option can be less expensive overall to the community since  districts qualify for educational discounts. Depending on the size of the  district, competitive bidding and subsequent negotiations can be a significant  cost saver to the community as well. </p>
<p>A  district-purchased program also tends to lead to a standardized device. I  learned from the mission statement of my second school, the Allendale Columbia  School in New York, that "structure should liberate, not confine."  While some in your community may want the personalization that BYOD affords,  the device you select should be a proverbial Swiss Army Knife. Personalization  shouldn't focus on variations in design,  color, brand or operating system so much as the capacity to shape how an  individual interacts, creates and consumes media with the device. </p>
<p><strong>Defining the  Education Goals of Your 1-to-1 Program</strong><br/>
This  leads to one of the most critical considerations: What do you envision students  and teachers doing with the devices? If your conversations have been dominated  by gigabytes, screen size, operating systems and cost, then you should ask  yourself: "Am I choosing a device based on my education goals? Or are my  goals being defined by my device?" If you believe that structure should  liberate, not confine, then seek a solution that solves for your educational  goals, not the other way around.</p>
