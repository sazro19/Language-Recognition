<p>The global digital English language learning (ELL) market is expected to grow 23.36 percent between 2017 and 2021, according to a new report by market research firm <a href="http://www.technavio.com">Technavio</a>.</p>
<p>English is spoken by more than 1 billion people worldwide, and is the second most popular language to learn after Mandarin, Technavio reports. ELL programs are gaining momentum because of globalization, urbanization and the desire for better education and employment opportunities. With the advent of the internet, information and communications technology (ICT) tools are being used to provide learning content in digital formats, Technavio said. Digital ELL consists of digital content and products that facilitate the learning of languages through ICT tools.</p>
<p>These include mobile apps, activities, e-books, games, videos, audio clips, digital software, learning lab equipment and online tutoring. These tools are interactive, allow real-time feedback and enhance the learning process as they involve different formats, Technavio said.</p>
<p>To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue generated from the sales of digital ELL products and services provided by the language learning institutions, as well as online language learning service providers.</p>
