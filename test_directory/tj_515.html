<p>Dremel has rolled out two new mobile apps for its latest 3D printer that allow users to print 3D models and monitor printers remotely.</p>
<p>The new app, called Dremel 3D, supports the<a href="https://3dprinter.dremel.com/3d40-edu-printer-benefits" target="_blank"> Dremel Idea Builder 3D40</a>, a 3D printer that is available in a configuration designed specifically for education. The education edition (3D40 EDU) provides curriculum, professional development and one-on-one customer support, as well as additional materials, including extra PLA spools, an extra build plate, extra tape for the build plate and a USB flash drive with curriculum-based 3D models.</p>
<p>The printer, which was previously available for preorder but is now shipping. The 3D40 already supported wireless and Ethernet printing, two rarities among 3D printers at this stage, as well as the common USB printing support. Now with the mobile apps, students can select a printer, start the build process and monitor progress on their iOS and Android devices.</p>
<p>The app also allows users to browse an online gallery of models and download models to a local 3D object library.</p>
