When working with  educational technology, responsible decision makers in schools recognize the  need for solid security and privacy practice in software applications. However,  defining an acceptable level of privacy protection, or an adequate level of  security, can feel imprecise. While some of the loudest conversations about  privacy and security try to reduce the issues to binary choice, the reality is  often more nuanced.</p>
<p>
As we navigate  evaluating the privacy and security protections of educational software, the  following questions and observations can help guide the process.</p>

<strong>What is collected?</strong> <br/>
The answer to this question can determine the level of review required for an  application. For example, an online calculator application that doesn't require  a login will generally be easier to review than student blogging software. When  evaluating what data an application collects, it is also important to consider  whether or not the data collected by the application is limited to just what  the application needs to function. It is not uncommon to see more information  collected than is needed by an application. If an application overcollects  information, it's an indicator that the entire application will require a more  thorough review.</p>

<strong>From whom is this information collected?</strong> <br/>
<a href="https://www.graphite.org/blog/privacy/the-long-life-of-a-data-trail" title="The Long Life of a Data Trail">Educational  data can be collected</a> in a variety of ways.  As an example, the information collected from a teacher as notes in a student  information system is going to be different from information collected directly  from a student. When only teachers have access to an application, this creates  a different set of needs and concerns from when students and teachers — or teachers,  students, and parents — all have accounts.</p>
<p>
<strong>Who can access and use the information that is collected?</strong> <br/>
When working with a vendor, it is essential to clarify who owns the data. When  we are talking about digital assets, access and ability to use the data often  make outright ownership superfluous. If a company claims no ownership rights  over the data but asserts that they can use or potentially share the data with  few restrictions, access to the data can be just as invasive to privacy as  ownership.</p>
<p>
<strong>Who can delete the information that is collected?</strong> <br/>
The ease with which data can be deleted is a good sign of how much actual  control a person has over information that he or she uses in an application.  You can check for the deletion process in two places: first, by creating a  sample account and reviewing the options within the application for deleting  that account, and, second, by reviewing their terms and reading about if or how  they describe their deletion process. Apps that don't allow accounts to be  deleted should be able to define why they don't support this basic feature.</p>
<p>
<strong>Beware of privacy settings.</strong> <br/>
Multiple issues exist with privacy settings. The issues that often get the most  attention focus on default settings that are too permissive, which can lead to  oversharing. However, most privacy settings are better described as visibility  settings. They control what can be seen by other users but not what is actually  shared with the vendor. Even if an application has robust visibility settings,  in most cases the vendor gets access to everything regardless. Any privacy  needs should be balanced against the potential sensitivity of data collected  within an application.</p>
<p><strong>What protections are in place to safeguard information?</strong> <br/>
Any application that stores student information will need to have adequate  security protections to safeguard against unauthorized access. While a full  information security review is outside the scope of this post, checking that  the site requires encryption is easy to do: the web address should begin with  "https://" — the final "s" indicates that the connection to  the website is encrypted. Once you have logged in to the site, try to remove  the "s" from the URL. You should be redirected back to the encrypted  connection. </p>
