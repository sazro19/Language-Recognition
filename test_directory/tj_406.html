<p>The e-learning market is predicted to experience significant global growth over the next five years, largely driven by advances in technology, evolving business needs and a number of emerging learning and development trends, according to <a href="https://www.docebo.com" target="_blank">Docebo</a>’s newly released research report, “<a href="https://www.docebo.com/elearning-market-trends-report-2017-2021/?utm_campaign=2016%2011%20eLearning%20Market%20Trends%20Report&amp;utm_medium=WP%20Download&amp;utm_source=PRWeb" target="_blank">E-Learning Market Trends and Forecast 2017-2021</a>.”</p>
<p>Docebo, an international learning management system (LMS) provider, draws from a number of other reports and sources in its latest e-learning market report. For instance, the report says the global corporate e-learning market is projected to reach approximate revenues of $31 billion by the end of 2020. This information initially came from <a href="http://www.technavio.com" target="_blank">Technavio</a>’s report, “<a href="http://www.technavio.com/report/global-education-technology-corporate-e-learning-market" target="_blank">Global Corporate E-Learning Market 2016-2020</a>.”  </p>
