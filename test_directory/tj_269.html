<p>Abumrad, 44, got his college degrees in creative writing and music composition from <a href="https://home.oberlin.edu" target="_blank">Oberlin College</a>. After college, he wrote music for movies and crafted documentaries for local and national radio shows.</p>
<p>Abumrad will be the opening keynote speaker at the <a href="https://www.iste.org" target="_blank">ISTE</a> (International Society for Technology in Education) conference Sunday, June 25. <em>THE Journal</em> caught up with him to talk about his background, experiences and thoughts on education and technology.<br/>
 <br/>
<strong><em>THE Journal:</em> How did you get into public radio?</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jad Abumrad:</strong> I was a struggling musician and writer, and flailing at both. During my post-college flail, my girlfriend, who’s now my wife, suggested radio. I studied both writing and music. Radio is kind of both, but it’s neither.</p>
<p>I started at <a href="https://www.wbai.org" target="_blank">WBAI</a>, a community radio station in New York City. I learned the basics of how you hold a mike, take bits of tape in between [interviews], make it make sense. It was so immediate, and I was always so hard on myself, I would get creatively blocked. But suddenly someone says something, and that’s your material — sound, language. I kept on doing it and moved to <a href="https://www.wnyc.org" target="_blank">WNYC</a>. And I happened to be decent enough at it, and in the building, when the program director in 2002 said, “Start experimenting.”</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> When and where was the first “Radiolab” show? How has it changed over the years?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abumrad:</strong> I would say early 2002 — January, February or March-ish. I had been working on a bunch of different shows. It sort of had a soft, fumbly beginning. It shifted and changed forms in the early beginning. The first time I did something, the actual thing people would call “Radiolab,” was 2005.</p>
<p>It has evolved in a hundred different ways. Initially it was just a show that I loved making. But I had no time to have a plan. I just thought, “I have to fill three hours.” I didn’t have time to make a vision. It happened so quickly, then I had to do it.<br/>
I didn’t expect it to catch on in public radio.</p>
<p>Up until about six years ago, it was just, like literally, the only expectation I had was related to the story in front of us. It was super hand-to-mouth. We worked right up until the last second [before it aired].<br/>
  <br/>
<strong><em>THE Journal: </em>What kind of effect did podcasts have on your show?<br/>
</strong><br/>
<strong>Abumrad:</strong> Podcasting gave us a lease on life. In 2006, I think that’s when we did our first podcast. We were able to experiment with sound, with music. And that was an evolution I couldn’t have ever anticipated. “Radiolab” was not just a show — it became a signifier of a style and a way of doing things. I never expected that to happen. I never expected it to be about science.</p>
