<p><a href="http://www.jmcss.org/" target="_blank">Jackson-Madison County Schools</a> in Tennessee has selected a new enterprise resource planning (ERP)
system to help staff manage the district's finances and human resources.</p>
<p>The
school district was looking for an ERP with better reporting
capabilities and security than its current system and collaborated with
the Madison County office to search for a replacement system. The
county and the school district took advantage of an existing contract
with <a href="http://www.njpacoop.org/" target="_blank">National Joint Powers Allianc</a>e (NJPA), a contract purchasing cooperative, to search for the new ERP.</p>
<p>The search lead them to the cloud-based <a href="http://www.tylertech.com/solutions-products/munis-product-suite" target="_blank">Munis</a> ERP system from Tyler Technologies. The district plans to implement the
Munis financial management, human resource management, employee
self-service and content management applications. As part of the
agreement, the company will provide Jackson-Madison County Schools with
hosting services, professional services, maintenance and support.
Because Munis is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) system, the district
won't have to invest resources in infrastructure upgrades, and
according to Chris Hepburn, president of Tyler's ERP &amp; School
Division, Munis "is ready to use off the shelf without customization."</p>

<p>"We
needed to upgrade our ERP system and Munis was a good fit because it
provides enhanced reporting functionality that will benefit the county
and school district," said Mike Nichols, finance director at Madison
County, in a news release. "Munis delivered as a SaaS model will allow
our staff to focus on other projects, while knowing that our ERP system
has built-in technical security."</p>
<p>Jackson-Madison County School
System operates 27 schools serving 13,000 students and employing 1,100
staff and 800 support staff. </p>
