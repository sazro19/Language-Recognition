<p><a href="http://www.santaclarausd.org/" target="_blank">Santa Clara Unified School District</a> in California has implemented a cloud-based communications system to
help administrators, faculty and staff communicate and collaborate with
each other.</p>
<p>The implementation was driven by requests from
teachers and staff, who wanted a communications tool that could
integrate with the district's Google Apps for Education platform, which
they use for email and productivity applications. Following a product
evaluation process, district decision-makers chose <a href="https://www.ringcentral.com/" target="_blank">RingCentral</a> in early summer 2016, and the implementation was complete in time for the new school year.</p>
<p>With
RingCentral, district administrators, faculty and staff can communicate
using the mode and device of their choice. They can use RingCentral to
make secure voice calls, send fax and text messages and conduct audio
conferences and online meetings. RingCentral offers mobile apps for
iPad, iPhone and Android devices, and integrates with Google Apps for
Education to give staff "more flexibility and efficiency in completing
work," according to a news release from the company.</p>
