<p><a href="https://www.sandiegounified.org/" target="_blank">San Diego Unified School District</a> has gone public with its work  related to running 1-to-1 programs for 47,000 of its 132,000 students. The  announcement arrived <a href="https://blog.google/topics/education/san-diego-unified-school-district-designs-todays-classroom-tomorrows-workplace/" target="_blank">in a blog article that appeared  on  a Google site</a> with a byline from Cindy Marten,  the district's superintendent. This could turn out to be one of the country's  largest student device deployments in a school district this year.</p>
<p>The district,  which has 226 schools, has deployed 16,000 <a href="https://www.google.com/edu/products/devices/" target="_blank">Chromebooks</a> running Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/edu/products/productivity-tools/" target="_blank">G Suite for Education</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/edu/products/productivity-tools/classroom/index.html" target="_blank">Google Classroom</a>.</p>
<p>The  adoption of the devices is being accompanied by other digital transformation  initiatives. Marten said the district's chief innovation officer, Dan Stoneman,  created a "178-point rubric" to use in evaluating classroom  technology, "with careful attention to the skills we believe will be  important in the future workplace — namely, the skills to collaborate  effectively and work in the cloud."</p>

<p>Coverage  by <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/sd-me-google-school-20161005-story.html" target="_blank">The San Diego Union-Tribune</a> called the work the district and  Google are doing a "collaboration." The daily paper said Google's "chief  education evangelist," Jamie Casap, had recently toured campuses and met  with teachers and students to learn how the company's gear and applications were  being used in the classroom. The company also "promised" to provide  professional development to educators on how to flip their classrooms and work  with students on becoming "good digital citizens."</p>
<p>The  announcement emphasized the monetary savings of choosing Chromebooks over other  kinds of computing devices. "Our district saved nearly $10 million by  choosing Chromebooks for our [1-to-1] roll-out," Marten wrote. The  Union-Tribune put the cost for each computer at $284.50 "before taxes and  shipping." However, she insisted, the devices "are much more reliable";  she didn't specify what the refresh cycle would be for the new computers.</p>
<p>Among  the schools that have begun implementing their 1-to-1 programs is <a href="https://www.sandiegounified.org/schools/jefferson" target="_blank">Jefferson Elementary</a>, an internationally minded STEAM  magnet school that issued 147 Chromebooks to its students in grades 4 and 5 this  year. "Even though we're only a month into the school year, we're starting  to see positive results," Marten reported.</p>
<p>For  example, students in a fourth grade class used the new devices to interview  peers, write profiles in Google Docs and work in teams to edit drafts. "The  students aren't just learning from me; they're learning from each other,"  said Teacher Lisa Martin. "I have been able to step back and become a  better facilitator."</p>
