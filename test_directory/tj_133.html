<p>An Indiana school district received a $700,000 grant from <a href="https://uncarrier.t-mobile.com/empowered" target="_blank">T-Mobile's  EmpowerED program</a>, covering the cost of personal MiFi hotspots for  every student in grades 3 through 8 for the next two years. The <a href="http://www.decaturproud.org/" target="_blank">Metropolitan School  District of Decatur Township</a>, located in Indianapolis, issued the  devices along with iPads to students. High schoolers in the district already  have comparable access through a separate program.</p>

<p>A MiFi is a phone-sized wireless router that can be  connected to a cellular network to provide internet access to multiple devices  outside of the school building. Students received the <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/alcatel-linkzone-mobile-hotspot" target="_blank">T-Mobile-branded  Alcatel LinkZone</a>, an LTE hotspot that can deliver access to 15 users  for up to seven hours on a battery. EmpowerEd is the company's program for  narrowing the "homework gap" or "digital divide" by  providing off-campus devices and data plans to students. The complete expense  of the service is picked up by the company; there is no cost to students or  their families.</p>
<p>The equipment will enable students who lack "adequate  internet access" in their homes to be able to do school work, <a href="https://campussuite-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/484008/2fabe5fc-59b7-11e6-943a-22000bd8490f/1809034/d6107582-9989-11e8-a70f-0a9302a9ba54/file/Mifi%20Devices%20Info%20Sheet%20(1).pdf" target="_blank">according  to a parent memo</a> on the program. It will also provide connectivity  "no matter where" the students are working, such as at a relative's  house. The device filters internet access comparable to what's provided in the  district's schools. By using the MiFi, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete and submit assignments on the  district's learning management system, Canvas;</li>
<li>Use the online databases maintained at the  public library;</li>
<li>Read ebooks in the district's online library  system or use its World Book online encyclopedia;</li>
<li>Complete assignments on Pearson math;</li>
<li>Search the internet for personal interest or  school work; and</li>
<li>Log into and use Naviance, the district's  college and career readiness curriculum.</li>
</ul>
<p>The school district is in its fourth phase of a multi-year  digital transformation. This fall, every student and teacher  —  including those  in grades 1 and 2  —  will be outfitted with a mobile device for classroom use.  Last year, the school system received a <a href="http://www.decaturproud.org/info-tech/digital-learning-grant-oer-projects" target="_blank">digital  learning grant</a> that enabled 48 teachers to create open education  resources for use in their classrooms; that funding covered MacBooks for every  participant.</p>
