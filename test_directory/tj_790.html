<p>Every December, <em>THE Journal</em> convenes a panel of five ed tech leaders and asks them to gaze into the future. This year, we presented our virtual roundtable with 10 instructional technology topics, and they offered their prognostications about what will be HOT ⇧, LUKEWARM ⇔ or LOSING STEAM ⇓ in 2015. While all of our experts agreed that student data privacy will continue to be a major concern, there was lively debate in most other areas. This divergence of opinion centered on a question that districts around the country are grappling with: With such an abundance of technology options, how do educators pick the right solution and — most importantly — deploy it in a way that truly helps students learn?</p>

<p><strong>Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) ⇧</strong></p>
<p><strong>Karen Billings</strong>: BYOD is hot given the prevalence of popular mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones, student preference for using their devices, better access to the Internet at school and lower cost.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Drexler</strong>: Recent studies have shown that more than 50 percent of school-age students own a smartphone and/or a tablet, and that increase in personal access has lit a spark under this already popular movement in K-12 technology implementation. However, for BYOD to be successful, schools must plan carefully for implementation, considering how they will provide access to students who may not have a mobile device, and have proper policies in place.</p>
<p><strong>Larry Johnson</strong>: The economics behind BYOD are driving interest, especially in more affluent districts where kids are more likely to have at least a smartphone, and likely a laptop as well. It is simply cheaper to fund the have-nots than to try to support everyone. IT departments are getting more comfortable dealing with a range of devices, especially if the key use is the network.</p>
