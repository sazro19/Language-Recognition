<p>In a recent study, 10 percent of simulated phishing e-mails sent to users in education institutions were successful, causing the recipient to click on a fraudulent link. That's according to the <a href="http://www.wombatsecurity.com/state-of-the-phish" target="_blank">2018 State of the Phish</a> report from <a href="http://www.wombatsecurity.com/" target="_blank">Wombat Security Technologies</a>, in which researchers measured the average click rates on phishing tests across various industries. Education had an average click rate of 10 percent; the industries that performed worst in the tests were telecommunications and retail, with 15 percent and 14 percent average click rates, respectively.  </p>
<p>The study, which looked at user awareness and behavior around phishing and other data security issues, gathered data from several sources:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Analysis of tens of      millions of simulated phishing attacks sent through Wombat's Security      Education Platform between Oct. 1, 2016, and Sept. 30, 2017;</li>
<li>Survey responses from      10,000-plus information security professionals in more than 16 industries;      and</li>
<li>A third-party survey of      about 3,000 technology users in the United States, United Kingdom      and Germany.</li>

<p>Other findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Across all industries, 76 percent of organizations experienced phishing attacks in 2017;</li>
<li>Nearly half of information security professionals believe the rate of attacks has increased compared to 2016;</li>
<li>76 percent of organizations now measure their susceptibility to phishing, up from 66 percent in 2016; </li>
<li>95 percent of organizations train their end users on how to identify and avoid phishing attacks; and</li>
<li>61 percent of users in the U.S. could correctly define what phishing is, while just 46 percent knew what ransomware is.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report also pointed to one area where awareness is particularly low among U.S., U.K. and German adults: "smishing," or SMS/text message phishing. Just 16 percent of survey participants could correctly define smishing, while 67 percent couldn't even venture a guess.</p>
<p>"Smishing (SMS/text message phishing) has generally been considered a regional, consumer-based threat as opposed to a global cybersecurity concern," the report noted. "However, media coverage of successful smishing attacks rose during 2017 — a trend that's sure to increase in 2018 given that awareness of this threat vector is low." </p>
