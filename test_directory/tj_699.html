<p>Barracuda Networks has released the latest version of <a href="https://www.barracuda.com/products/ngfirewall" target="_blank">NG Firewall</a> with new
and updated features designed to simplify setup, administration and management
for K-12 and higher education networks.</p>
<p>Barracuda NG Firewall is a line of network firewalls that are available as
hardware or virtual appliances. Unlike traditional network firewalls, which
filter traffic based on ports and protocols only, NG Firewall is designed to
filter traffic based on applications or other types of traffic passing through
network ports. The latest version adds features for educational institutions,
including support for safe searching policies, YouTube EDU content filtering, a
self-service portal for users and an iOS app for system administrators.</p>
<p>Key features of Barracuda NG Firewall include:</p>
<ul>
<li>SafeSearch for enforcing strict Web searching policies;</li>
<li>YouTube for Schools for restricting students' YouTube EDU access to
    education content only;</li>
<li>Integration with wireless access points for visibility and policy
    enforcement;</li>
<li>Remote access management for Mac OS X, Windows and iOS devices through a
    self-service portal; and</li>
<li>Barracuda NG Remote iOS application that allows network administrators to
    access the NG Firewall control center and appliances remotely using their
    mobile device.</li>
</ul>
