<p>Thousands of elementary students from across the United States are expected to travel virtually to Washington state’s <a href="http://parks.state.wa.us/564/Penrose-Point" target="_blank">Penrose Point</a> and <a href="http://parks.state.wa.us/540/Lime-Kiln-Point" target="_blank">Lime Kiln Point</a> state parks in May to see orcas and other aquatic life in their natural habitats through Journey to the Parks, a series of high-tech distance learning experiences.</p>
<p>The free, interactive events, funded by the <a href="http://wspf.org" target="_blank">Washington State Parks Foundation</a>, facilitated by <a href="http://www.inspiredclassroom.com" target="_blank">Inspired Classroom</a> and provided by the experts at <a href="http://killerwhaletales.org" target="_blank">Killer Whale Tales</a> and <a href="http://www.harborwildwatch.org" target="_blank">Harbor WildWatch</a>, will leverage a state-of-the-art satellite-based mobile classroom from <a href="https://www.gci.com" target="_blank">GCI</a> (General Communications Inc.), Alaska’s largest telecom, to connect students with wildlife and experts. The Penrose Point experience will be held May 9-11, while the Lime Kiln Point experience will be held May 15-17.</p>

<p>“To virtually transport students from across the country to remote state parks in Washington, strong, reliable broadband connectivity is key,” said Pam Lloyd, vice president of GCI Education and Healthcare, in a statement. “Our mobile classroom gives students the opportunity to visit faraway places they’d never experience otherwise. It’s exciting to see technology and education come together to offer students a one-of-a-kind learning experience.”</p>
<p>In addition to GCI, technology partners <a href="http://www.polycom.com" target="_blank">Polycom</a> and <a href="http://www.vision.net" target="_blank">VisionNet</a> will empower classrooms to connect remotely to the events.</p>
<p>Participating classrooms will get to see biologists at work, take virtual park tours and learn about orca identification and research, including: the specific criteria that whale researchers use to identify whales; and why tracking whales is an important part of whale research.</p>
<p>Students will also participate in a hands-on activity where they will experience what it is like to communicate using only sound. During the event at Penrose Point State Park, students will take a close look at marine invertebrates using a virtual microscope. Naturalists and marine biologists will discuss the shoreline ecosystem near the park.</p>
<p>“Our intention is to expand this educational service by utilizing the signature experience of state parks as learning platforms and, as a result, bring state parks within reach of a wider range of children and families,” said John Floberg, executive director of Washington State Parks Foundation, in a statement.</p>
<p>Classrooms interested in participating in can register at <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbQBbGGrJXdfKs3jQpLPn3yXfh3A9NB7ivJVHo7f691U7zwQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">this site</a>.</p>
<p>Inspired Classroom, an interactive distance learning company, will record the content and provide it to classrooms around the globe, the company said.</p>
