<p>Although schools have spent billions on computer hardware and
software for the classroom, only 16 percent of teachers think their
schools are using it effectively, according to a new report sponsored
by online and blended learning service provider <a href="http://www.edgenuity.com/">Edgenuity</a>.</p>
<p>The report, Teachers’ Dream Classroom Survey, is based on an
online survey of 400 middle and high school teachers across the United
States. It found that 91 percent of teachers agree that "technology
provides a greater ability for teachers to tailor lessons and homework
assignments to the individual needs of each student." However, 48
percent say the technology in their classroom is outdated. </p>
<p>The survey also found that teachers who think their schools
have done a good job integrating technology are significantly more
likely to be satisfied with its effectiveness at facilitating learning
and engaging students, and 80 percent of those teachers think
technology helps them achieve learning objectives.</p>
<p>“The rush to technology has often been about devices, with
less thought given to the instructional purpose for using computers in
the classroom,” said Sari Factor, CEO of Edgenuity, in a prepared
statement. “Educators are now beginning to focus on how to integrate
technology to improve student outcomes.”</p>

<p>In addition to supporting personalized learning and student
engagement, effective technology implementations can also help teachers
save time, according to the report. The survey found that 61 percent of
teachers think they need more time to plan, research and collaborate,
and Edgenuity sees technology as a time-saver for teachers. Given more
time in the school day, teachers said they would focus more on helping
struggling students, developing creative lessons and tailoring lessons
to students.</p>
<p>Other findings from the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>73 percent of teachers surveyed think classroom technology
creates more opportunities for research projects;</li>
<li>71 percent think technology helps students learn through a
combination of direct instruction and learning on their own; and</li>
<li>67 percent think technology helps personalize learning for
each student.</li>
</ul>
