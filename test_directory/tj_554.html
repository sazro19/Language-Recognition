<p>Tennessee's <a href="http://www.colliervilleschools.org/" target="_blank">Collierville  Schools</a> is adopting a new customized online registration solution in an  effort to centralize data collection.</p>
<p>"We want to cut down on the tremendous amount of  paperwork we distribute and collect, as well as the time that school staff and  families spend on completing registration," said Andy Field, student  services supervisor at Collierville Schools, in a prepared statement. "We  live in a tech-savvy community and want to remain in the forefront of education  technology to provide our families with the most modern and efficient  resources."</p>
<p>The district was already using <a href="http://www.powerschool.com/" target="_blank">PowerSchool's</a> <a href="http://www.powerschool.com/powerschool-sis/" target="_blank">student information system</a> (SIS) and decided to adopt a custom solution from the company using SmartForm  technology, which "collects relevant data based on previously  entered information or choices," according to a news  release. The new tool allows families with multiple children in the district to  snap information from one student entry to another and, once submitted, the  data is "reviewed, polished and formatted to meet district policies  and then delivered into the SIS, resulting in up-to-date and accurate records  on the first day of school."</p>

<p>Other features of the new tool include the ability for families  to sign off on school policies and multilingual forms.</p>
<p>"Moving this process online will allow school staff to  focus on building relationships with our families and students," said  Russell Dyer, chief of staff for the district, in a prepared statement. "We  want everyone to get acclimated to the new school year, rather than investing  time to go through and fill out 30 sheets of paper."</p>
<p>The new registration tool will be put into use this spring.</p>
