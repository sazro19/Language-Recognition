<p>When doing the work to protect student data privacy, a  school district's first priority is often to focus on the most sensitive  information, such as Social Security numbers, financial information or health  data, and ensure that information is adequately protected. Once that work is  complete, districts are able to address appropriate protection measures for  other important data, including student contact information, grades, test  scores and more. It is an almost never-ending funnel of information to cover,  and it often cannot all be addressed at once.  </p>
<p>Given the already wide array of responsibilities that school  systems face and the limited resources they possess, it is critical to <a href="https://cosn.org/blog/prioritizing-privacy-work-technology-enabled-school-district" target="_blank">prioritize  the work based on a threat matrix</a>, as previously discussed by CoSN. </p>

<p>Not to be forgotten in all of this, however, is data that are  passively collected through tracking technologies used by various applications,  including the school system website. Common situations that involve the use of  tracking technologies include serving the website content to a user,  understanding how a website is used, understanding if a website or application  is functioning properly, providing users with the ability to easily interact  with social media through a website or other online platform, as well as serving  advertising. </p>
<p>All tracking technologies have privacy implications. Whether  those implications would be problematic for your school system often depends on  what third parties are used to perform those functions, how they are configured  and if the user is an adult or a student. </p>
<p>The first step in understanding if your tracking  technologies are being used in ways that are appropriate and aligned with your  legal responsibilities is to know what is being done and by whom.<strong> </strong>Doing so will help you make smart  decisions about what third parties to permit and how to keep control over your  data ecosystem. To get started, download the <a href="https://cosn.org/file/cosn-district-application-inventory-worksheet-finalxlsx" target="_blank">CoSN  (the Consortium for School Networking) District Application Inventory Worksheet</a> and take an inventory of not only the third parties operating on your website,  but all of your key district applications.  </p>
<p>With your inventory in hand, consider whether all of the  tracking technologies are permitted by current privacy laws and your district  policies. It's often easiest to start this work by examining your school system  website. What third parties are operating on your site? What is the purpose for  each, and what data are they collecting to do the work? Are they doing  something more with the data than providing the service to your district? If  so, can they be configured differently to address the issue or not? Answering  these questions will empower you to make well-informed decisions about what  should be on your website.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We have found value in  using selective third-party applications integrated into our website. We try to  stay aware of what tracking elements are captured by the products, but that  requires due diligence to understand. It's a significant undertaking, but we  are constantly improving. We work diligently to review our third-party  integrations and to inform our visitors about them and about the data they may  capture. – Louis McDonald, Director, Technology Services, Fauquier County  Public Schools</em></p>
<p>Many districts rely on the hosting provider or developer to  manage their websites, but remember that they are also your third-party service  provider. While they may be able to provide you with answers to some of your  questions about the tracking technologies that are being used, they do not own  or operate the site – you do, and what ends up on the site is your  responsibility.</p>
<p>In addition,<strong> </strong>ensure  that your website has a privacy policy that comes from you, as the operator of  your website, not from your third-party provider. The policy should adequately  disclose how all personally identifiable data is being collected, handled and  shared; this includes the information collected passively through tracking  technologies and what is shared with your hosting provider.    </p>
<p>Once you've successfully managed this work on your own  website, you will be better informed and better equipped to examine how other  technology providers are operating, improving the maturity of your district's  privacy program as you go.  </p>
