<p>The <a href="http://home.lausd.net/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Unified School District</a> is rebranding its troubled 1-to-1 program and putting new leadership in charge of device and curriculum decision-making. What has been known as the Common Core Technology Project will now be called the <a href="http://achieve.lausd.net/Page/5960" target="_blank">Instructional Technology Initiative</a>. The group running that project will have as a new Committee Chair Judy Burton, founding president and CEO of <a href="http://www.laalliance.org/" target="_blank">Alliance College-Ready Public Schools</a>.</p>
<p>The Alliance is a network of 22 charter middle and high schools with 11,000 students in low-income communities in the district, including one named after Burton herself: <a href="http://www.heritagecollegeready.org/" target="_blank">Alliance Judy Ivie Burton Technology Academy High School</a>. All of the schools provide student access to technology; many of the schools run a formal blended learning model, <a href="http://www.laalliance.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=191024&amp;type=d&amp;pREC_ID=395157&amp;hideMenu=1" target="_blank">Blended Learning for Alliance School Transformation (BLAST)</a>.</p>

<p>In her new role as chair Burton will lead a committee of teachers, administrators, parents, students, community members and a representative from the district's Bond Oversight Committee to review device and curriculum options to best support student learning. Director Bernadette Lucas will remain as director of the project.</p>
<p>The Common Core Technology Project had hit troubled waters when, under previous district leadership, <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2014/12/02/fbi-steps-into-l.a.-unified-ipad-fiasco.aspx" target="_blank">questions arose regarding the selection of Apple iPads and curriculum from Pearson Education</a> for the massive 1-to-1 program, which would have put devices into the hands of all of its 650,000 students.</p>
<p>"We are pleased that Judy will be building on her experience at Alliance to promote effective integration of instructional technology across all Los Angeles schools," said a statement from the Alliance. "We have seen the benefits that 21st century tools can bring to improve student performance, and hope that all students will have the opportunity to benefit from new technological innovations."</p>
