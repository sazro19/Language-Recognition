<p><a href="http://www.cfisd.net/en/" target="_blank">Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District</a> (CFISD) in Texas is upgrading to a 100 gigabit private optical network
to support a bring-your-own-technology (BYOT) policy and improve access
to Web-based educational resources.</p>
<p>Cypress-Fairbanks ISD serves
114,000 students and employs 14,000 staff members at more than 100
campuses and service centers. High school students and staff members
bring as many as three mobile devices to school with them, straining
network capacity. The district also has a vision of "providing students
and staff 'Anytime, Anywhere' broadband access so they can easily
interact and collaborate with peers and engage in distance learning
initiatives," according to a news release.</p>
<p>With the help of
E-rate funding, the district is supporting its BYOT policy and vision
of anytime, anywhere broadband access. "Our mission is to maximize
every student's potential through rigorous and relevant learning
experiences by preparing students to be 21st century global learners,"
said Frankie Jackson, chief technology officer of Cypress-Fairbanks
ISD, in a prepared statement. "To achieve it, we are proactively
building a high-capacity network that will support the increased
demands of wireless technologies, mobile devices and high-speed
connectivity."</p>

<p>The new network is designed in accordance with the <a href="http://www.cosn.org/SEND" target="_blank">Smart Education Networks by Design</a> (SEND) Initiative through the Consortium of School Networking (CoSN). The network itself is a collaboration between <a href="http://www.pslightwave.com/" target="_blank">Phonoscope Lightwave</a> and <a href="http://www.ciena.com/" target="_blank">Ciena</a>. Ciena's <a href="http://www.ciena.com/products/6500/" target="_blank">6500 Packet-Optical Platform</a> and <a href="http://www.ciena.com/products/5160/" target="_blank">5160 Service Aggregation Switch</a> will provide high-capacity connectivity between the school district's
six main hubs and three data centers through Phonoscope Lightwave's
dark fiber network footprint, according to a news release. The network
will also connect the district's educational campuses and three data
centers. Phonoscope Lightwave will provide managed services over the
new network.</p>
