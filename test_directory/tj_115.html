<p>In late December, families in the <a href="https://www.sandiegounified.org/" target="_blank">San Diego Unified School District</a> were <a href="https://www.sandiegounified.org/sites/default/files_link/district/files/All%20student%20email%20-%20GNotice%20of%20Data%20Breach.pdf" target="_blank">notified  of a data breach</a> launched through successful phishing emails. The  number of affected people totaled more than 500,000, according to the district.  A phishing email is an online scam in which a message appears to be from a  legitimate source to encourage recipients to click on a link that enables  criminals to fraudulently capture the information provided.</p>
<p>The school system estimated that before it was discovered the  viewing and copying of some of the personal data had gone on for nearly a year,  beginning in January 2018. The incident was uncovered in October by internal IT  staff investigating a flurry of phishing emails, which were used to gather  log-in information of some 50 staff members throughout the district.</p>
<p>According to the district, school police have also  identified a "subject of the investigation" and have blocked stolen  credentials.</p>
