<p><a href="http://www.chawanakee.k12.ca.us/" target="_blank">Chawanakee Unified School
District</a> near Fresno, CA has implemented a new student information system
(SIS) to make it easier for teachers, students and parents to access and update
information.</p>
<p>The small district, which serves 1,100 students at five schools, had been
using another SIS, but found the system difficult to navigate and cumbersome to
access and enter data. It also couldn't integrate with the district's learning
management system (LMS) or other systems and was difficult to customize.</p>
<p>The school staff members who are the primary users of the district's SIS
formed a selection committee to evaluate alternatives. Specifically, they were
looking for a system that was easy to use and that could produce clean reports
and export data easily. After considering the available options, they selected <a href="http://www.powerschool.com/powerschool-sis/" target="_blank">PowerSchool SIS</a>.</p>
<p>PowerSchool SIS is a Web-based system designed for K-12 schools. It includes
a range of district and school-level tools for administrators, a gradebook and
other tools for teachers, and real-time access to grades, attendance and
assignments for parents and students through a Web portal or mobile app.</p>

<p>According to information from the company, Chawanakee district selected
PowerSchool because of its ease of use, clean interface and hosted option, so
the district wouldn't need to buy new equipment to support the system. The team
was also impressed with the tool's customizable reporting features and
application programming interface (API) to support integration with phone
systems, learning management systems, special education systems and enrollment systems.</p>
<p>So far the administrators, teachers, staff, students and parents are happy
with the new student information system. According to Patrick Wilson, the
director of <a href="http://www.chawanakee.k12.ca.us/Minarets%20HS/2336-Charterinfo.html" target="_blank">Minarets Charter High School</a> in the district, students and
parents in particular have enjoyed the simplified user interface. "We've
seen a 20 percent increase in parent logins in just the short time we've
been using it," said Wilson in a prepared statement. District staff have also
enjoyed being able to move data in and out of the system and navigate the
interface quickly.</p>
