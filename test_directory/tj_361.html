<p>Teachers in the <a href="http://www.uscsd.k12.pa.us" target="_blank">Upper St. Clair School District</a> in Allegheny County, PA, have been training with virtual reality (VR) tools this month, so they can eventually bring the world to their classrooms.</p>
<p>During a training event on Feb. 10, 24 social studies teachers practiced using a range of VR gadgets, from the low-end <a href="https://vr.google.com/cardboard/" target="_blank">Google Cardboard</a> ($8-$15) to the high-end <a href="https://www.vive.com/us/">HTC Vive</a> ($800). Their aim was to experience virtual reality and all its fun features, but also to think about how they will plan lessons around VR activities and make sure the exercises will have real educational value.</p>
<p>The teachers said they could imagine teaching about world cultures, travel, geography and religions using the VR headsets. Virtual tours during training included Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Florence and Rome, Italy; and Manhattan from above.</p>

<p>Tyler Samstag, director of instructional innovation at the <a href="http://www.aiu3.net" target="_blank">Allegheny Intermediate Unit</a> in Homestead, PA, said virtual reality tools have the potential to support students with special needs, such as autism. The multisensory nature of virtual reality — a fully immersive visual and aural experience — could help engage students on the autism spectrum by giving them a safe space to explore and experiment with different activities, <a href="http://triblive.com/local/allegheny/11904233-74/virtual-reality-students" target="_blank">Samstag told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</a>.</p>
<p>Some drawbacks to immersing students in VR would be the price tag ($800 per headset for an HTC Vive), the need to hook up with compatible computers, the requirement of high-speed internet access and safety concerns in some school districts.</p>
