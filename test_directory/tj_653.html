<p><a href="https://www.pearson.com/" target="_blank">Pearson</a>
has launched a new version of its student
information system (SIS), PowerSchool, featuring a major update in the area of
standards and grades with new data visualization tools and enhancements
in the
areas of data export, scheduling and academic performance indexes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pearsonschoolsystems.com+%e2%80%ba+/" target="_blank">PowerSchool
9.0</a> also has a new unified PowerSchool
mobile app that will be
available to parents and students on both iOS and Android devices. The
app has
a new user interface, improvements to the user experience and new
communication
and push notifications that will help parents and students get real-time
data
on grades, attendance and teacher comments.</p>
<p>There is also an update to Oracle security with
PowerSchool
9.0, making it the only SIS with Oracle Exadata Optimized status.
Finally, a
new PowerSchool Registration component is available as an option, a
self-service module that provides online enrollment and registration
capabilities.</p>
<p>"We have a lot of customizations already, so I
usually
approach a major new release with a bit of apprehension, but PowerSchool
9.0
pretty much just works," said Jeremy Davis-Vollrath, PowerSchool
administrator
at <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/ss/" target="_blank">California
State Special Schools</a>. "The user interface is intuitive and
user-friendly. The new data visualization and export frameworks provide
the
seeds for exciting new growth."</p>
