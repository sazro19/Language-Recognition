<p><a href="www.lightspeedsystems.com" target="_blank">Lightspeed
Systems</a> has expanded access to <a href="lightspeedsystems.com/.../classroom-orchestrato" target="_blank">Classroom
Orchestrator</a>, the classroom management tool it introduced last
November.</p>
<p>The tool, previously available
as a standalone app for Windows devices or as part of the company's <a href="www.lightspeedsystems.com/mobile-learning-essentia..." target="_blank">Mobile
Learning
Essentials</a> bundle, is now also available on Chromebooks.</p>
<p>Classroom
Orchestrator is
designed to help teachers monitor student activities on their own
devices in
the classroom. It can provide a centralized thumbnail view of an entire
class
that allows teachers to see who's on task, who may need help and who's
ready to
move on to the next task. Teachers can move from an overall view of the
entire
class and drill down into the activities of individual students for more
detail
and even record a student screen.</p>
<p>It can
also be integrated
with the school's own student information system and provide filtering
when
appropriate.</p>

<p>"We are
excited the next
phase in Classroom Orchestrator development is here," Lightspeed Systems
President Brian Thomas said. "Chromebooks play an important role in
many
schools around the world."</p>
<p>In the
past, Lightspeed
Systems has said it plans to add other features to the tool like virtual
hand
raising, instant chat and live polling in the coming months.</p>
