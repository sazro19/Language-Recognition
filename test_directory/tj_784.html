<p>A new mobile platform now will let educators deliver
live, interactive
classes to their students via smartphones.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wiziq.com" target="_blank">WizIQ</a> representatives say their new <a href="https://www.wiziq.com" target="_blank">WizIQ
Live Mobile Learning
Platform</a> is a first-of-its kind breakthrough that will allow
teachers and
students to interact any time anywhere via mobile devices.</p>
<p>The new mobile platform, available now at the App
Store for
iPhones and later this month at the Google Play store for Androids, will
give
teachers at every educational level the freedom to schedule live classes
and
meetings that students can join from any location.</p>
<p>"Educators can now unlock the true potential of
mobile
learning," said WizIQ Founder and CEO Harman Singh.</p>
<p>At the same time, students can use their smartphones
or tablets
to access previously recorded classroom sessions, course videos, audio
sessions, documents and presentations. On-demand content sharing allows
instructors the freedom of "just-in-time" uploading of audio and video
recordings regardless of time or location.</p>

<p>While the new platform facilitates real-time
communication and
collaboration between and among educators and students, it also allows
them to stay
up to date with notifications about live classes, tests and assignment
deadlines.</p>
<p>"After all," Singh added, "people are now accessing
more
content on mobile devices than anywhere else. Why should education be
any
different?"</p>
<p>The platform is built on a cloud-based learning
management
system (LMS), <a href="https://www.wiziq.com/Virtual_Classroom.aspx" target="_blank">Virtual
Classroom</a>, that WizIQ introduced in October and that is designed to
facilitate live online interaction between teachers and students on
other
devices. The Live Mobile Learning Platform being introduced now is an
advancement on that development.</p>
<p>Unlike older on-premises LMSes, Virtual Classroom
requires no
dedicated IT support for set-up, built-in video streaming and the
ability of students
to share content online.</p>
