<p>Shipments  of PCs have inched upward. According to <a href="http://www.idc.com/" target="_blank">International Data Corp.</a>, sales of desktops, notebooks and  workstations worldwide totaled 60 million units in the first quarter of 2017,  reflecting a year-over-year growth rate in that period of 0.6 percent. While  IDC acknowledged that a sub-percentage point increase "was arguably flat,"  the IT market research firm said it was still noteworthy for being the first  sign of expansion for PC sales in five years. IDC originally forecast that  shipments would fall by 1.8 percent for the quarter. In fact, the last time  growth was recorded was 2012, an era when "many users still considered PCs  their first computing device."</p>
<p>The  estimates come from IDC's <a href="http://www.idc.com/tracker/showproductinfo.jsp?prod_id=1541" target="_blank">Worldwide Quarterly Personal  Computing Device Tracker</a> and don't cover shipments of tablets or x86 servers.</p>
<p>"The  traditional PC market has been through a tough phase, with competition from  tablets and smartphones as well as lengthening lifecycles pushing PC shipments  down roughly 30 percent from a peak in 2011," said Research Manager Jay  Chou, in a prepared statement. While consumer demand for PCs "will remain  under pressure," (except for the gaming market), he added, the commercial  market is waking up and "beginning a replacement cycle" that's  expected to push growth.</p>

<p>In the  United States, overall PC shipments for the first quarter tallied 13.3 million  units. That's a drop year-over-year, attributed to a slump in notebook sales.  While consumer sales especially slowed down domestically, the commercial PC  market was bolstered by the growth of Chromebook sales.</p>
