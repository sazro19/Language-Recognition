<p>The learning  environment is changing in our schools, and technology is playing a big role.  How schools are acquiring their resources can be as affecting as the changes in  instructional practices used by teachers. Better prices mean savings, and those  dollars can be used to support a school's other needs. But price isn't the only  factor to consider. </p>
<p>Here are  eight recommendations for school technology procurement:</p>
<p><strong>1. Remember that purchasing and  procurement are not the same.</strong><br/>
  Procurement  is the process that leads to the acquisition of goods and services, which  typically ends with purchasing — simply the exchange of money for those good  and services. It's important to focus on the procurement process first and not  fixate on purchasing too soon. Doing so can sometimes make the purchase price  too great a factor in decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>2. Seek solutions, not equipment or  software.</strong><br/>
  Understand  the difference between commodity purchasing and solutions procurement. If you  need 100 USB flash drives, one brand is probably as good as another, and a  commodity purchase would be fine for almost any occasion. But procuring a  literacy-intervention software suite or a device to support a 1-to-1 learning  program can't be easily distilled into a simple list of specifications. That is  a solutions procurement, and you're likely going to need to do a lot of  research and potentially make a competitive bid.</p>

<p><strong>3. Be descriptive, not prescriptive.</strong><br/>
  When issuing  a request for proposal or information (an "RFP" or an  "RFI"), use descriptive language to frame the challenge you're  attempting to solve. Use prescriptive language to establish the hard limits and  requirements. Avoid setting minimum technical requirements when possible;  instead, consider describing the successful outcome. </p>
<p>For example,  if you know you want students to be able to create and edit video, you know you  want a device with enough storage capacity and processing power to store the  content and manipulate it. While you may think you know how much storage space  you need or how fast a processor your device should have, in today's world of  tablets, laptops, and Chromebooks, the ways in which these platforms solve for  this task are very different. </p>
<p>Instead, use  descriptive language to explain the types of video creation and editing that  you want students to be able to do, and allow the providers to propose a  solution that meets the need you describe. Don't solve the problem for the  provider.</p>
<p><strong>4. Language matters — a lot.</strong><br/>
  It's  important to use language that clearly lets bidders know what's a requirement  (e.g., "Provider must ..."). But avoid ambitious language such as  "Provider should...." Additionally, when describing the challenges  you want your bidders to solve, include qualitative language and instruct them to  be descriptive. Consider the difference between "The Bidder must include  the capacity for student to ___ " and "The Bidder must describe how  it will provide the capacity for students to ___."</p>
<p>In some  instances, particularly for services such as repair or replacement of equipment,  include quantitative language. It isn't enough to ask for an easy process to  get repairs completed. When time is critical, you will likely find that  prescriptive language is better. For example, "The Bidder must describe  how it will provide warranty repairs at no additional cost in no more than two  school days. The process must be easy for school technicians to initiate and  complete."</p>
<p>Lacking  qualitative and quantitative measures in your requirements may lead a bidder to  respond, "We understand and will comply with this requirement" — a  perfectly adequate response if you don't ask for more.</p>
<p><strong>5. Flexibility can allow for  innovation.</strong><br/>
  Directing  bidders to provide descriptions of their solutions and setting clear  requirements is important. But it's also important to include a way for bidders  to propose innovative solutions that may not fit the expected description. When  I issued RFPs for the state of Maine, part of our template included:</p>
