<p>Academic online database <a href="www.researchomatic.com" target="_blank">Researchomatic</a> has just added 20,000 new topics in the field of literature to its collection of nearly 4 million topics across a wide range of academic fields.</p>
<p>Researchomatic.com is an e-library of essays, articles and research papers intended to help high school and college students as they prepare their own academic assignments. Students can search its database for specific topics.</p>
<p>They will get multiple summaries of a few hundred words each on the topic they select. They can also copy and paste citation information that attributes the information to Researchomatic.com. Then, if they would like to see the complete document or to cite the original source, they can log in and get the complete information for a fee that varies depending on the subject area, length of the document and quality of the content.</p>
<p>Researchomatic Executive Director Gary Barbieri said the addition of the new literature topics is in response to the demand from people doing research on that subject.</p>

<p>"We are constantly working to expand the e-library and increase its relevance," Barbieri said. "The addition of topics is specifically for students and professionals majoring in literature and making it possible for them to easily access information under a single Web site."</p>
<p>Among the 20,000 new literature topics, there are:</p>
<ul>
<li>5,000 devoted to American literature;</li>
<li>6,000 to Antique literature;</li>
<li>4,000 to English literature;</li>
<li>2,000 to Asian literature; and</li>
<li>3,000 to Shakespeare studies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Researchomatic is developing a mobile version of its e-library that it plans to introduce in coming months for what it says are the 3 million people who have used its service.</p>
<p>A note on its Web site states that "Researchomatic discourages any act that constitutes plagiarism. You are strongly advised not to use Researchomatic's content word for word in your academic projects."</p>
