<p>There has been a lot of buzz lately around artificial intelligence and cognitive computing, with spending for both on pace to hit $12.5 billion in 2017, according to <a href="https://www.idc.com/" target="_blank">International Data Corp.</a> (IDC). </p>
<p>IDC forecasts double-digit growth over last year in its latest analysis, “<a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P33198" target="_blank">Worldwide Semiannual Cognitive/Artificial Intelligence Systems Spending Guide</a>,” released Monday. Worldwide, these segments will increase 59.3 percent and achieve a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 54.4 percent through 2020, when global revenues are expected to reach $46 billion.</p>
<p>“Intelligent applications,” including cognitively-enabled process and industry applications that use machine learning techniques, are forecast to make up the largest area of spending in 2017 at $4.5 billion. Cognitive-related IT and business services come in second place at $2.5 billion, followed by cognitive/AI software platforms at $3.5 billion. According to a news release, these “provide the tools and technologies to analyze, organize, access and provide advisory services based on a range of structured and unstructured information.”</p>
