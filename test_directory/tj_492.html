<p>Right now the biggest area for category one funding requests  in the <a href="http://www.usac.org/sl/" target="_blank">E-rate</a> program is for lit fiber —  major bandwidth connectivity. That line item in applications for the 2016  funding year totals $1.3 billion in pre-discount dollars, a request that trounces  every other type of category one service included on applications by at least a  factor of five-to-one. Compare that to $256 million, which is the total of  funding requested for telephony services and $86 million for wireless data  services.</p>
<p>However, telephony shows up on more applications — 18,561 —  compared to 14,823 for lit fiber data and 1,157 applications for wireless data.  Cellular voice comes in third as far as the number of applicants requesting  that kind of discount — 9,299 in total.</p>
<p>E-rate is a program run by the <a href="http://www.usac.org/default.aspx" target="_blank">Universal Service Administrative  Company</a> (USAC), to help public schools and libraries update their computing  and telecommunications infrastructure by granting pre-approved discounts to  schools and districts on equipment purchase and implementation.</p>

<p>The top item for category two dollars, which covers internal  connectivity, is switches, which falls somewhere in the neighborhood of  $700,000 in requests. Wi-Fi, which is just about at the $400 million mark,  comes in second. Related components, cabling and installation, are third at  under $200 million.</p>
<p>Those figures come from analysis done by Funds for Learning,  a company that consults with school districts on their E-rate funding  applications. The organization used <a href="http://www.usac.org/sl/tools/default.aspx" target="_blank">data</a> provided by USAC,  which administers the E-rate program for the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/" target="_blank">Federal  Communications Commission</a>.</p>
<p>Funds for Learning noted that the initial round of funding  decisions arrived just 21 days after the filing window closed — making it  "the fastest in the history of the E-rate program." That first funding  wave includes more than $17.7 million in commitments for 2,251 approved  applications.</p>
<p>"Internet connections for schools and libraries are  essential, and the E-rate program exists to support this important  mission," said Funds for Learning CEO, John Harrington, in a prepared  statement. "The fast turn-around is a positive indication that funds will  begin flowing and USAC will release applications quickly."</p>
