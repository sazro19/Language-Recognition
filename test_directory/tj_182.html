<p>District administrators using <a href="http://www.getcatchon.com/" target="_blank">CatchOn</a> to evaluate and manage ed tech usage across schools will now notice a more streamlined experience for Chromebook management owing to <a href="https://edu.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>’s <a href="https://edu.google.com/partners/" target="_blank">Education Partner Program</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.getcatchon.com/" target="_blank">CatchOn</a> delivers real-time data on which apps are being used, how often and where to help keep track of technology investments. The administrative tool is designed to measure the financial impact of apps by analyzing district data, revealing the percentage of the budget per app and comparing it with the consumption across an entire district. “CatchOn is the first administrative tool that provides real-time data across every app, device and operating system used in districts,” according to a company representative. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the platform <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2017/03/13/ed-tech-accountability-platform-addresses-education-app-sprawl.aspx" target="_blank">addresses the abundance of education apps</a>, helping districts and schools invest wisely, inform training, improve usage and spot trends.</p>

<p>As a Google partner, CatchOn is now fully integrated with Chromebooks, meaning district administrators can use the tool to see which apps and services students and teachers are using on their devices. </p>
<p>“Before CatchOn, it was virtually impossible for us to know with certainty which services and subscriptions were actually being used across the district,” said Shad McGaha, chief technology officer at Wichita Falls Independent School District in Texas, in a prepared statement. “As we bring more Chromebooks into our schools, understanding usage with CatchOn will be an important part of how we plan our technology initiatives.”</p>
