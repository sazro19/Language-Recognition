<p><a href="http://www.newton.k12.ma.us/site/default.aspx?PageID=1" target="_blank">Newton Public Schools</a> is adopting a new student
information system (SIS) in an effort to improve efficiency and student outcomes.</p>
<p>With more than 12.500 students across 21 schools, the Massachusetts-based district issued a request for proposals, created by a
stakeholder search committee, with more than 400 attributes regarding the SIS it sought, as well as implementation and training relating to
the system. Following demonstrations from four companies, the district settled on <a href="http://www.skyward.com/" target="_blank">Skyward
</a>.</p>
<p>"We were looking for more than what the product can do for our district, but also for a company our district can partner with on the
training and implementation of this student information system," said Jack Polnar, information technology services manager at Newton Public
Schools, in a prepared statement. "Skyward was above the rest of the systems we reviewed for reasons such as the extensive feature set within
the Family and Student Access portal as well as its reporting capabilities and more."</p>

<p>The district will be the first in its state to adopt the Skyward SIS.</p>
<p>"Entering a new state requires a working partnership with the district and we couldn't ask for a better partner than Newton Public Schools,"
said Kevin McFerrin, executive vice president of business development at Skyward, in a prepared statement. "As we expand our presence in
Massachusetts, we look forward to working with Newton to help them achieve their goals through thought leadership, best practices and software
tailored to their specific needs."</p>
