<p><a href="http://www.comptia.org/home.aspx" target="_blank">CompTIA</a>, a nonprofit association for the IT industry, is seeking volunteers to help build and deploy an evangelism platform in an effort to raise interest in IT careers among women and girls.</p>
<p>Launched by the organization's <a href="http://www.comptia.org/membership/communitiesandcouncils/women.aspx" target="_blank">Advancing Women in IT Community</a>, the effort is part of a goal to reach out to "10,000 individuals about the opportunities available to women in the IT field," according to a CompTIA news release.</p>
<p>"Our goal is to promote STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education to young women in junior high and high school," said Michelle Ragusa-McBain, manager, Global Ingram-Customer Partner Experience for <a href="http://www.cisco.com/" target="_blank">Cisco</a> and community vice-chair, in a prepared statement. "We're also interested in reaching out to female veterans seeking post-military careers and professional women in other fields who may be ready for a career change."</p>
