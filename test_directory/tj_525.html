<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.dell.com/en-us/">Dell</a> and<a href="http://www.aerohive.com/"> Aerohive</a> have launched a hybrid network system with new cloud-managed wired and wireless capabilities. The collaboration, an expansion of an existing<a href="http://en.community.dell.com/dell-blogs/dell4enterprise/b/dell4enterprise/archive/2016/03/07/the-dell-campus-vision-one-network-to-rule-them-all"> One Network</a> concept, provides more access from a broader range across campuses and data centers, and includes new in-rack systems devised to speed up server and storage migration to 10G connectivity. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The system has already been adopted by<a href="http://www.qms.bc.ca/"> Queen Margaret’s School</a> on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The private day and boarding school faced the challenge of high demand in multiple locations during weekends and after-school hours. Students wanted to access the school’s network from multiple devices and stream content, with demand for personal content as high as classroom-related content. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Queen Margaret’s School deployed Aerohive AP121, AP230 and AP330 access points throughout its campus and classrooms. Students and faculty could then access cloud-based applications such as<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/business/explore-office-365-for-business#paxhJouJDRHSvXt2.97"> Office 365</a>,<a href="https://www.edmodo.com"> Edmodo</a>,<a href="https://www.schoology.com"> Schoology</a> and<a href="http://www.myeducationbc.info"> MyEducation BC</a>, the provincial<a href="http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/education"> Ministry of Education’s</a> student information system. The school’s IT team also introduced a secure, web-based print system for students and staff. </p>

<p dir="ltr">The ability to access applications or the Internet from almost any location or personal device has proven very popular for students, staff and guests. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“Unified wired and wireless network management enables Queen Margaret’s School to have a more simple-to-use and cost-effective network solution, which delivers the benefits of mobility to all our campus users,” said Tobias Staley, manager of innovation and technology at Queen Margaret’s School, on the Aerohive website. “On top of the shared vision for cloud-managed IT, the service and support we receive from Aerohive and Dell are unparalleled and are a key reason we will continue to work together as our network and IT infrastructure expand.” </p>
<p dir="ltr">This co-branded system, announced Tuesday, incorporates Dell N-Series switches and Aerohive access points into Aerohive’s<a href="http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/hivemanager-ng/pd"> HiveManager NG</a>, a cloud-based management solution. HiveManager NG provides a high level of interoperability for devices, users and management, Dell said in a prepared statement. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Another company that is already using the hybrid network system is<a href="https://movement.com"> Movement Mortgage</a>, a South Carolina-based mortgage company that employs more than 2,000 people at more than 300 branches across the United States. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“To have a unified wireless platform across all operations and branch offices, and have it just work has undeniably advanced the efficiency and productivity of our employees, as well as streamlined operations for our IT staff,” said Will Simons, Movement Mortgage’s IT director, in a press statement.</p>
