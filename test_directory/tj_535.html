<p>Software for managing Apple devices in a classroom or other  settings has gotten an update to leverage features of iOS 9.3. The <a href="http://www.jamfsoftware.com/products/casper-suite/">Casper Suite</a> "Spring  2016" release from <a href="http://www.jamfsoftware.com">JAMF Software</a> takes advantage of Apple's managed "lost mode" to enable IT to locate  and recover lost or stolen devices without compromising student or staff  privacy. When lost mode is enabled for a given user's device, it displays a  customized lock screen message that IT has specified, is disabled from use and  sends its location to IT.</p>
<p>Casper Suite is intended to automate computing device activities  IT staff may take care of manually, such as inventory, distribution, updates  and maintenance. A self-service model enables users to take care of certain  activities themselves without needing administrative credentials.</p>
<p>The latest version of the software lets a teacher customize  what apps will appear on a home screen. A "shared" mode, which can  reside alongside a 1-to-1 program, enables students that share their devices  during the day to get a personalized learning experience. The function works  with <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/">Apple School Manager</a>, which  serves as a portal for iPads used in the classroom and allows students to be  granted managed Apple IDs.</p>

<p>The program also allows a teacher to launch all devices in  the classroom to a specific app, website or book and share work openly through  Apple TV or to the teacher's device.</p>
<p>"For years, school districts have had to make the  choice between 1:1 and shared iPad programs. The tradeoff has been a personalized  learning experience," said Dave Saltmarsh, <a href="http://www.jamfsoftware.com/solutions/education/">education evangelist</a> at the company. "With iOS 9.3 and Casper Suite, schools will no longer  have to make this choice. They will be able to deliver a personalized  experience for each and every student regardless of the school's implementation  model."</p>
