K-12 students between February 13 and March 12, 2014. It found that while 93
percent of students have wireless access to the Internet at home, only 62
percent have Wi-Fi at school, limiting their access to digital learning
resources for personalized instruction.</p>

    classroom more often than they do now (71 percent of elementary, 67 percent
    of middle and 56 percent of high school students);</li>
<li>51 percent of students surveyed indicated they think it's important for their schools to provide
    them with a laptop on a 1-to-1 basis, and 43 percent
    <ey>
    said they would like a tablet on
    a 1-to-1 basis;</ey></li>
<li>1 in 6 students attend a school where laptops or tablets are provided
    on a 1-to-1 basis;</li>
<li>61 percent of middle and 71 percent of high school students said they
    need to be connected to the Internet at school at least twice a week to do
    their school work, and 26 percent of middle and 34 percent of high school
    students said they need to be connected daily;</li>
<li>Tablet usage is increasing, with 66 percent of elementary, 58 percent of
    middle school and 42 percent of high school students using tablets, compared
    to 52 percent, 43 percent and 33 percent last year, respectively; and</li>
<li>Smartphone usage is also increasing, with 44 percent of elementary, 58
    percent of middle school and 75 percent of high school students using
    smartphones regularly, compared to 35 percent, 47 percent and 60 percent
    last year, respectively.</li>
