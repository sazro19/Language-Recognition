<p>Maker education shouldn't be treated as a flavor of the month. </p>
<p>So says Jaclyn Gerstein, an educator, author, blogger and education technology enthusiast who lives in Santa Fe, NM. She teaches gifted education to second through sixth graders at <a href="http://sweeney.sfps.info" target="_blank">Sweeney</a> and <a href="http://salazar.sfps.info" target="_blank">Salazar Elementary Schools</a> in Santa Fe. She also teaches education technology to graduate and doctoral students through <a href="https://www.waldenu.edu" target="_blank">Walden University</a> and <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu" target="_blank">Boise State University</a> online.</p>
<p>Gerstein will be presenting at two sessions during the <a href="http://www.iste.org" target="_blank">ISTE</a> (International Society for Technology in Education) conference: “<a href="http://conference.iste.org/2017/program/search/detail_session.php?id=108177165" target="_blank">A Framework for Maker Education: Frontloading and Reflecting on Maker Experiences</a>,” on Sunday, June 25; and “<a href="http://conference.iste.org/2017/program/search/detail_session.php?id=108218663" target="_blank">Design Thinking and Universal Design for Learning for Makerspaces, STEM and STEAM</a>” on Monday, June 26.</p>

<p>In her ISTE bio, she says, “I don’t do teaching for a living. I live teaching as my doing … and technology has amplified my passion for doing so.” Gerstein spoke with <em>THE Journal</em> to discuss her ideas about maker spaces and why they’re part of the next educational revolution.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> We’ve heard a lot about the maker movement. What do you mean by “a framework for maker education”?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jackie Gerstein:</strong> In education technology, there’s the flavor of the month, and people jump on these bandwagons. I’ve been doing maker education for years; I come from the field of experiential education.</p>

<p>While I’m a big proponent of maker education, I’m afraid it’s going to be a flavor of the month, in education and education technology. Learning — that’s my background. You need to provide a context. Just doing an activity then moving on is not enough. </p>
<p>We need to be frontloading or framing the experience, and think about what you really want your students to really think about and focus on. Do you want them to focus on certain standards, develop team building, have tolerance for frustration?<br/>
You want to plant those seeds into students’ heads.</p>
<p>Afterward, reflection becomes a huge piece. Have them take pictures, give them some questions they have to blog about. We don’t learn from experience; we learn from reflecting on the experience.</p>
<p>Have them tinker and play with these things. It’s getting them into the engineering process. Try it and reflect on it. Teachers like doing hands-on activities. Have a pre- and post-activity. That really situates it, gives it context. We don’t want to leave learning to chance.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> How do you tie making things from 3D printers and creating robots  back to the fundamentals of what kids should be learning? </strong></p>
<p>Gerstein: I have a website called <a href="http://www.makereducation.com" target="_blank">MakerEducation.com</a> which talks a lot about this. 3D printers — that’s the seductive end. And the high-tech robots. But they’re out of reach of a lot of schools, Salazar and Sweeney for instance. They’re Title I schools. There’s no way they’re going to have 3D printers.</p>
<p>If done correctly, you can connect [making things] to STEM, to STEAM. They are hands-on. It’s not, “Let’s get out a book and read the chapter.” </p>
