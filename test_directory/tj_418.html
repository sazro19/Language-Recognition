<p>A new research project from <a href="http://www.scholastic.com" target="_blank">Scholastic</a> finds that the overwhelming majority of educators (97 percent) agree that “equity in education for all children should be a national priority.”</p>
<p>Teachers and principals also agree (87 percent) that “many of their students face barriers to learning that come from outside the school environment.” While a greater percentage of educators in high-poverty schools (98 percent) report having students with barriers, 66 percent say the same in low-poverty schools.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.scholastic.com/teacherprincipalreport" target="_blank">Teacher &amp; Principal School Report</a>, released Thursday, surveyed more than 4,700 public school pre-K–12 teachers and principals representing all 50 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>Some other key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both teachers and principals are spending their own money to help meet students’ needs. On average during the past year, teachers in high-poverty schools spent $672, and teachers in low poverty schools spent $495;</li>
<li>Principals in high-poverty schools spent $1,1014, and principals in low-poverty schools spent $514;</li>
<li>Only 46 percent of teachers in high-poverty schools received discretionary funds from their school, district or parent-teacher organizations, compared to 61 percent of teachers in low-poverty schools; </li>
<li>Teachers identified their top five funding priorities to address barriers to learning. Forty-seven percent said they needed technology devices and digital resources in school;</li>
<li>Forty-eight percent of teachers and 39 percent of principals said access to the Internet and other learning resources outside of school is not adequately available for their students; and</li>
<li>Among teachers and principals, 65 percent in high-poverty schools and 57 percent in mid-high-poverty schools said access to the Internet and other learning resources outside of school is not adequately available for their students. </li>
