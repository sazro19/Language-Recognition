<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> will be introducing new education-useful features into <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/EN-US/windows/windows-10-upgrade" target="_blank">Windows 10</a>,  including a quick device set-up app, an imaging and configuration tool, a  utility to simplify Windows 10 devices for testing and enhancements to Windows  Update.</p>
<p>The update news comes out as Microsoft has been crowing  about data from <a href="http://www.futuresource-consulting.com/" target="_blank">Futuresource  Consulting</a> that reported <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/04/14/chromebooks-account-for-half-of-k12-device-shipments.aspx" target="_blank">domination  of Windows as the top global platform for mobile devices in K-12</a>. Microsoft  holds 43 percent of market share on the worldwide K-12 segment; in the United  States, that's 22 percent.</p>
<p>Alongside the Windows 10 updates, the company is releasing <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/04/14/microsoft-builds-out-education-offering-with-classroom.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft  Classroom</a>, which provides course management operations.</p>

<p>The new functionality will appear in what Microsoft is  heralding as its Windows 10 Anniversary Update, due this summer.</p>
<p>The set-up app enables a school staffer to set up classroom  PCs in three steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Saving a setup file to a USB drive; </li>
<li>Turning on the classroom computers; and </li>
<li>Putting the USB drive into the device.</li>
</ol>
<p>For school IT staff, an updated <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn916113(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank">Windows  Imaging and Configuration Designer</a> tool will let them set-up shared devices  in bulk for class scenarios where students share devices.</p>
<p>A new "take-a-test" app locks down the browser to  secure the device for online assessments. For summative exams, students won't  have copy and paste privileges, access to files or the ability to do other  activities outside of the testing environment. For formative testing, the app  works with whatever assessment website the teacher uses.</p>
<p>Windows Update now includes "active hour"  policies, which IT people can set to update devices outside of class times.</p>
<p>The updated release of Windows 10 will also offer Windows  Ink, a technology that enables the user to write on his or her device as if it  were paper. That feature will be available through Office applications and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge" target="_blank">Microsoft Edge</a>,  the company's Windows 10 browser.</p>
<p>And the company is promoting the use of Cortana in the  classroom, to help students do queries without special log-in when the device  isn't in lockdown mode.</p>
<p>At least one district has bought into the use of Windows 10  for its student device program. <a href="http://www.kent.k12.wa.us/" target="_blank">Kent  School District</a>, located about 25 miles south of the Microsoft main campus,  has been piloting Windows 10 in four K-12 schools over the last year. Recently,  the district began installing Windows 10 on PCs in its elementary school  libraries and committed to implementing the operating system on all 24,000  district devices by the start of the next school year.</p>
<p>The Kent school system, which uses <a href="https://products.office.com/en-US/student/office-in-education" target="_blank">Office 365  Education</a>, has also installed Windows 10 on older computers, finding it to  be a means to getting "extra life" out of its devices. "It's not  intuitive to think you can put a newer operating system on an older computer  and it will actually run better," said Kent School District CIO Stosh  Morency, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/business/2016/04/14/kent-school-district-starts-rolling-out-windows-10-to-24000-devices/" target="_blank">in  a Microsoft blog article</a>. "Because of some of these benefits, we've  extended our four-year refresh cycle to five years for some of the  devices."</p>
