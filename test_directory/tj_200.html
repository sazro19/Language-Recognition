<p>In 2016  106 Arkansas school districts had upgraded their Internet access, leading to  242,378 students obtaining more bandwidth. That brought the percentage of  districts meeting the "minimum connectivity goal" of 100 Kbps per  student up to 95 percent.</p>
<p>Earlier  this month, Asa Hutchinson, the governor who pushed for those upgrades,  announced that as of this month every public school, charter school and  education service cooperative in the state had been moved to high-speed  broadband and had surpassed the target. The latest upgrade to the Arkansas  Public School Computer Network means that all 293 of the education  organizations now have access to twice the minimum — 200 Kbps per student — most  connected by fiber.</p>
<p>That 100  kbps target was originally set by the <a href="http://www.setda.org/" target="_blank">State Education Technology  Directors Association</a> in 2008 for all districts in the country. Since then, the recommendation has  been updated. Depending on the size of the district, <a href="http://www.setda.org/priorities/equity-of-access/broadband-imperativeii-2016/" target="_blank">broadband capacity</a> as suggested by SETDA varies  between 87 Kbps and 1,500 Kbps per user.</p>

<p>However,  the state-wide coverage is still a feat. Arkansas joins just five other states — Hawaii,  Kentucky, North Dakota, South Carolina and Wyoming — that have also met the original  minimum goal.</p>
<p>"In  2015, when I issued the directive to connect all our schools, I didn't know  exactly how it would look, but I knew for sure that information systems and the  education department would get the job done. They did, and the final product  looks grand," said Hutchinson in a statement. "Not only are we  leading the way, we surpassed the federal goals and set a standard for the rest  of the nation."</p>
