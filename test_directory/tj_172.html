<p><a href="http://www.kajeet.net/" target="_blank">Kajeet</a> has  selected the winners of its <a href="http://www.kajeet.net/homework-gap-grant" target="_blank">Homework  Gap Grant</a>, expanding the number of awards from three to five in response to  the number of responses.</p>
<p>The grant was designed to help schools pilot  one of Kajeet's home access solutions in an attempt to provide internet access to  student outside of school. Among the five winners, four will use the company's <a href="http://www.kajeet.net/kajeet-smartspot" target="_blank">Kajeet SmartSpots</a>, and one  will use the <a href="http://www.kajeet.net/kajeet-smartbus" target="_blank">Kajeet SmartBus</a>.  The winning districts will launch their pilots this month and carry them on  throughout the school year.</p>
<p>"We were deeply impressed by their  stories, and of course the need that expands across our nation to provide all  students equal access," said Daniel Neal, CEO and founder of Kajeet, in a  prepared statement. "With so much need, we increased the number of grant  winners contributing to closing the Homework Gap in even more districts."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.roadrunners24.net/" target="_blank">Stanfield  Elementary School District 24</a>, home of the longest bus route in Arizona,  will use a Kajeet SmartBus solution to provide internet access to students who  spend more than an hour on the bus each way.</p>
<p>"I'm excited that our students are going  to have an opportunity to use digital remediation programs that we now have in  place," said Kimberly Christie, math specialist at Stanfield, in a  prepared statement. "They were unable to do so before because they lacked  Internet access."</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.msd.k12.wi.us/" target="_blank">School  District of the Menomonie Area</a> will offer students Kajeet SmartSpots as  they expand their 1-to-1 program to grades 6-12.</p>
<p>"This grant offers an opportunity for us  to pilot providing after-school Internet access," said Katie Krueger, director  of technology services for the district, in a news release. "The Kajeet  devices will help things go smoothly. By giving students Internet access at  home, we are able to remove even more barriers than we anticipated in the first  year of the 1-to-1 rollout."</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ucfsd.org/" target="_blank">Unionville-Chadds  Ford School District</a> recently began moving toward an all-digital curriculum  after a 1-to-1 rollout and adoption of a new learning management system (LMS).</p>
<p>"We are hoping now for timely turn-in of  assignments, students to do research at home and maybe staying for clubs after  school instead of just doing homework," said Justin Webb, director of  technology at Unionville-Chadds Ford, in a prepared statement. "I want to  help those kids in need."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.warsaw.k12.in.us/" target="_blank">Warsaw  Community Schools</a> launched its 1-to-1 program three years ago and has rolled  devices out across all grades and allows them to go home with students in  grades 5-12. Many students in the rural district do not have access to the  internet at home or transportation to a local business where they might  otherwise access the web.</p>
<p>"We're really looking forward to giving  those students who don't have Internet access at home the opportunity to  collaborate with peers and enjoy the rich digital content that other students currently  have," said CTO Brad Hagg in a news release.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.webutuckschools.org/pages/Webutuck_CSD" target="_blank">Webutuck Central  School District</a> is also largely rural, with many students coming from  economically disadvantaged homes.</p>
<p>"I want to ensure that our students have  access to anything that they want — whatever they want to learn, on whatever  platform, in and outside of school," said Bill Brown, director of  technology at Webutuck, in a prepared statement.</p>
