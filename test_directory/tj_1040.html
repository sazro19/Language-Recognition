<p>Tom Wheeler is fighting back against his latest net neutrality court loss. Yesterday, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed new rules for preventing what he called "improper blocking of and discrimination among Internet traffic."</p>
<p>In January, the FCC took a legal beating in a federal court when <a href="http://www.verizon.com/home/verizonglobalhome/ghp_business.aspx">Verizon</a>, one of the largest Internet broadband providers in the country, worked to overturn rules regarding what classifies as an "open Internet." <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2014/01/16/net-neutrality-ruling-impact-on-education.aspx" target="_blank">As previously reported</a>, the FCC had established three basic rules for defining what open means. First, broadband service providers need to be transparent about how they manage their traffic. Second, providers aren't allowed to block traffic. And, third, they can't throttle back on services that compete with their own. But a Washington, D.C. federal court threw out the second and third rules.</p>
<p>What was kept intact was the FCC's authority to govern broadband providers' treatment of Internet traffic. In fact, reminded the FCC in an FAQ, "the court upheld the conclusion that without rules of the road, broadband providers could harm consumers and the economy."</p>

<p>It's that basis around which Wheeler appears to be building a case for revamping how the FCC handles net neutrality. Wheeler is proposing a set of steps "to ensure that the Internet remains a platform for innovation, economic growth and free expression." His <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/document/fact-sheet-internet-growth-and-investment" target="_blank">stated goal</a>: to ensure that broadband providers don't block or create barriers to lawful content, Web sites or services.</p>
<p>First, he is pushing for approval of new rules to put Internet broadband providers on notice that they need to be on their best behavior:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>To enforce and enhance the transparency rule. This      one requires network operators to report on how they manage their Internet      traffic. Doing so, Wheeler added, would allow "edge providers," organizations      that use the Internet for delivery of goods and services, to have the "technical      information" they need to make business decisions.</li>
<li>To fulfill the "no blocking" goal. The court      decision found that although the "Open Internet Order" ban on blocking      Internet traffic was important, the FCC hadn't provided a "sufficient      legal rationale" to support the ban. Wheeler suggested that his organization      do more to make sure edge providers don't get blocked and that consumers continue      having access to the legal content they want.</li>
<li>To ensure discrimination doesn't happen. Wheeler proposed      setting a legal standard with guidance and predictability for use by edge providers,      consumers, and broadband providers; to monitor "on a case-by-case basis"      whether the standard is being met; and to identify activities by broadband      providers "that the Commission would view with particular skepticism."</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, Wheeler reminded the FCC that it retains the ability under the Communications Act to reclassify Internet access service as a telecommunications service instead of its current status as an "information service." The importance of that point, as <a href="http://business.time.com/2014/01/15/net-neutrality-ruling-paves-the-way-for-internet-fast-lanes/#ixzz2qVpjf0Zy" target="_blank">Time</a> magazine recently explained, is that broadband providers currently aren't viewed as "common carriers," thereby exempting them from the same kinds of regulations that prevent telecom companies from showing traffic discrimination.</p>
<p>Wheeler is taking his mission to maintain network neutrality to the American public. The commissioner opened a new docket, "<a href="http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/" target="_blank">Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet</a>," to solicit input over the next month regarding what actions the commission should take in light of the court's decision.</p>
