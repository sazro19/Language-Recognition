<p>Ransomware went up 16,700 percent from 2015 to 2016, though unique  malware samples declined over the same period, according to <a href="https://www.sonicwall.com/whitepaper/2017-sonicwall-annual-threat-report8121810/" target="_blank">a  new report</a> from network security firm <a href="https://www.sonicwall.com/" target="_blank">SonicWall</a>.  That growth of nearly 17 times represents a swell from about 4 million  ransomware attacks in 2015 to approximately 638 million last year.</p>
<p>Internet of Things (IoT) devices were also "compromised on a massive  scale," according to SonicWall, owing to poor security design.</p>
<p>"2016 could be considered a highly successful year from the  perspective of both security professionals and cyber criminals," according  to information released by the company. "Unlike in years past, SonicWall  saw the volume of unique malware samples collected fall to 60 million compared  with 64 million in 2015, a 6.25 percent decrease. Total malware attack attempts  dropped for the first time in years to 7.87 billion from 8.19 billion in 2015.  However, cyber criminals garnered quick payoffs from ransomware, fueled partly  by the rise in ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)."</p>

<p>Ransomware began to surge in 2016, according to the findings of the  report, ballooning from 282,000 attack attempts to 30 million over the course  of the first quarter and continued to rise throughout the year, with 266.5 million  attacks in the fourth quarter of 2016.</p>
<p>Factors that contributed to the rise of ransomware included the use of  exploit kits for delivery, the ability to more easily obtain and deploy  ransomware as a result of RaaS, easier access to the underground market, the  low costs of ransomware attacks and the low risk of being caught.</p>
<p>Other key findings of the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ransomware was the most common payload for  malicious e-mail attacks, at a rate of 90 percent for Nemucod attacks;</li>
<li>Ransomware attacks were widely distributed  across industries, with the most commonly attacked industry, mechanical and  industrial engineering, garnering only 15 percent of attempts;</li>
<li>Hackers developed overlays to trick Android  users into divulging login credentials by posing as legitimate apps, leading  Android to respond with security features designed to combat overlays.  Attackers then coaxed users into providing permissions to continue the use of  overlays; and</li>
<li>The number of compromised apps targeted to  adults on Google's Play store declined, but criminals continued to attack third-party  app stores with ransomware and self-installing apps as common payloads.</li>
