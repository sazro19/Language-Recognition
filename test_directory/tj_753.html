<p><strong><em>THE Journal</em></strong><strong>: </strong>How will the new E-rate application process differ from the old one?<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Chas Eberle:</strong> The <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/page/summary-e-rate-modernization-order">E-rate Modernization Order</a> took several steps to simplify the E-rate application process for funding year 2015 (FY2015). The overall process remains the same, though there are some significant changes to the forms. First, the FCC Form 470, which is used to seek competitive bids for E-rate supported services, and the FCC Form 471 must be submitted electronically. Over the next two funding years, all E-rate forms will transition to be electronic-only forms. Applicants and service providers can find all forms and instructions on the website of the Universal Service Administrative Company <a href="http://www.universalservice.org/sl/tools/forms/default.aspx">website</a>. USAC administers the E-rate program for the FCC. </p>

<p>Applicants must seek competitive bids for E-rate supported services by posting an FCC Form 470. There are a few changes to the FCC Form 470, which reflect changes the FCC made to the E-rate program. For example, the FCC now allows applicants to receive support for “Managed Internal Broadband Services,” which is reflected in the FCC Form 470 as an internal connections service type.  <br/>
From a process perspective, applicants still must wait at least 28 days from the time their FCC Form 470 is posted before selecting a service provider and must use price as the primary factor in selecting the winning bid. </p>
<p>The online FCC Form 471 has many new features intended to make the form more user-friendly and to save time. Schools that are part of a school district must now calculate their discounts on a districtwide basis. Form 471 Block Four also includes a tool for calculating each school or library’s five-year category two budget. Item 21 is now embedded in the Form 471, and applicants may no longer file separate Item 21 attachments.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal</em></strong><strong>: </strong>Are there are any specific services that E-rate might fund that were not funded before?</p>
<p><strong>Eberle:</strong> As mentioned above, the E-rate Modernization Order added Managed Internal Broadband Service (managed WiFi) and caching functionality to the E-rate program’s Eligible Services List (ESL). These services are consistent with the FCC’s goal of ensuring that schools have affordable access to high-speed broadband sufficient to support digital learning. Though the FCC is not currently considering adding or removing other services, the FCC revises the ESL annually. As part of that process, we release a Public Notice with a draft ESL and seek comment. Anyone interested in advocating for funding for additional services should review the draft ESL — typically released in the fall — and file comments.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that the E-rate Modernization Order focused on expanding funding for WiFi in schools and libraries. Though internal connections and basic maintenance of internal connections had been eligible for E-rate discounts, there was no funding available for what were previously called “priority two” services in FY2013 and FY2014. The Commission has now set a $1 billion annual target for internal connections funding (now designated as “category two”) and established a five-year, $150 (pre-discount) per-student budget for category two services. These steps are designed to provide more predictable and equitable funding for WiFi networks.<br/>
