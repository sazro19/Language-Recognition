<p>The days when e-discovery  consisted of handing over copies of e-mails to address Freedom of Information  Act (FOIA) requests, compliance regulations or other legal obligations are  over. Now, it's just as likely that the process of discovery will also entail  coming up with relevant presentations, text messages, social media posts and  Internet of Things data, according to a new research report on the topic of  e-discovery.</p>
<p>As author <a href="https://www.ostermanresearch.com/">Osterman  Research</a> stated in the report, six in  10 managers are at least "somewhat worried" that their organizations  will be sued. Four in 10 anticipate an increase in the number of e-discovery  requests they'll face over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Electronically stored  information, or ESI, is growing, making the e-discovery process more challenging  for those trying to comply with a request, Osterman said. A 2016 survey found  that organizations stored a mean of 49.3 gigabytes of e-mail data per user and  that total messaging-related storage during the previous 12 months had  increased a mean of 18 percent. With growth at that pace, the data per user  will reach 133 gigabytes by 2022.</p>

<p>The ability to retain, find  and produce various types of content varies, according to the survey. For  example, 80 percent of respondents said they were "well prepared" or  "very well prepared" to handle email up to one month old. That  dropped to 57 percent for email older than six months. On the other hand,  participants didn't show nearly the same level of confidence for other types of  content:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content  stored in Office 365: 44  percent</li>
<li>Content  stored by employees in cloud storage systems: 20  percent</li>
<li>Instant  messages: 18  percent</li>
<li>Content  stored in online applications such as Slack, HipChat or Jive: 12  percent</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, data generated by  Internet of Things devices "will increasingly be subject to  e-discovery." The report noted content from an Alexa-enabled Amazon Echo  device that was requested for a 2015 murder investigation. And "at least  five U.S. states now use data from automobiles' vehicle event data recorders to  determine the speed at which cars were traveling when they were involved in an  accident."</p>
<p>"As the proportion of  electronic content shifts primarily from documents created by humans to data  generated by things," the report stated, "we anticipate a growing  proportion of discoverable content will come from the latter."</p>
<p>The use of the cloud won't  release organizations from their responsibilities related to e-discovery, the  report emphasized. The cloud is making an impact on e-discovery in two ways.  First, the cloud is where the goods are increasingly kept. That means that  "e-discovery capabilities will need to adapt not only to the shift in venues  where data may be found but also to any limitations that may be imposed by the  cloud on e-discovery efforts, such as the speed of search from cloud-based data  repositories that are accessed from Internet connections that may not always be  adequate to the task at hand." Second, more cloud vendors have begun to  offer e-discovery, archiving and other capabilities, which can make the work of  e-discovery easier for the client.</p>
<p>The report offered several  best practices related to e-discovery work, including three "basic  principles" decision makers are encouraged to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retain only what's necessary and only for as long as  necessary. The report advised, "When records can be safely deleted, the  deletion process should occur quickly with a carefully prescribed plan for  'defensible deletion.'"</li>
<li>Be ready to "rapidly identify suspect or  non-compliant content." Having a standard response for dealing with this  kind of content, the report explained, will help prove that the organization is  being proactive in dealing with it.</li>
<li>Manage content to minimize risk. The approach should  encompass systems, policies and training to minimize legal compliance risks,  such as "inaccurate identification of content for retention, systematic  failures to delete appropriate content and insufficient care by employees in  following corporate policies."</li>
</ul>
<p>"There is a lot at stake  for firms that are not ready to respond quickly and appropriately to  e-discovery requests. And, as this paper outlines, cobbling together manual  processes and calling it a 'compliance' program has become unacceptable to  insurance companies and the courts," said Founder Michael Osterman in a  prepared statement. "So, business and IT leaders would be well advised to  immediately take a proactive approach to their e-discovery readiness and, in  doing so, enable their firm to stay competitive, avoid the consequences of  non-compliance and earn the trust and loyalty of clients."</p>
