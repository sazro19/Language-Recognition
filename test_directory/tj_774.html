<p>The <a href="www.smfc.k12.ca.us" target="_blank">San
Mateo-Foster City School District</a> in Foster City, CA
is automating the lottery system it uses to assign transfer students
within the
district.</p>
<p>For more than 15 years, the district with 12,000
students in
20 schools has used a labor-intensive paper-based lottery system to
determine
which of the 1,000 students who request transfers each year would be
able to do
so.</p>
<p>This year, it will begin using an online system
designed and
deployed by <a href="https://www.infosnap.com" target="_blank">InfoSnap</a>,
a cloud-based registration management system provider, instead.
District Enrollment and Communications Coordinator Amber Farinha said
that, not
only will the streamlined lottery process save "countless hours of
hand-entering applications," it will give school staff
members a way to better
manage school waiting lists online. It will also allow more efficient
communication with families via e-mail and mailed notifications.</p>
<p>"We've done the math and InfoSnap will save us
thousands of
dollars just in manpower alone," she said.</p>

<br/>
<p>Since the San Mateo-Foster City School District has a
large
Spanish-speaking population, InfoSnap's online lottery process also
provides
multilingual localization so that transfer request forms can be filled
out in
Spanish as well.</p>
<p>"We were looking for an online-based lottery solution
that
would make it easier for families to apply for a transfer," Farinha
said. "This
is an investment for our district that will provide a clear and concise
lottery
process."</p>
