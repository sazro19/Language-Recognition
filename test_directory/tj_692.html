<a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/" target="_blank">IMS Global Learning Consortium</a>
 has launched a new initiative designed to make school
leaders aware of the availability and benefits of open interoperability standards.


<p>Dubbed the IMS K-12 Open EdTech Ecosystem Initiative, the program will be led by the organization's <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/I3lc.html" target="_blank">K-12 leadership council</a> (I3LC) and
"will also include new technical collaboration to speed adoption of open standards such as sharing of code that provides integration into
legacy systems," according to a news release.</p>
<p>"School leaders need to know that they can trust that an ecosystem of interoperable digital curriculum, tools, apps and learning platforms
that enables a more personalized student experience based on open standards is taking shape rapidly and that their districts can begin
implementation with a few simple steps," said Rob Abel, CEO of IMS Global, in a news release. "The purpose of the IMS K-12 Open EdTech
Ecosystem is to get a majority of U.S. districts on a road that will provide them many options for innovation and protection of their
technology and curriculum investments into the future."</p>

teachers with a digital ecosystem that meets the teaching and learning demands of the 21st Century," said Barbara Nesbitt, director of
instructional technology at Pickens, in a news release. "For us this means a robust infrastructure that supports interoperable digital
resources that work on any end-user device. We are committed to giving our teachers and students a central hub with single sign-on access to
