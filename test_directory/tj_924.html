<p> The world's hunger for hardcopies is far from abating, despite some recent slides in peripheral shipments. The worldwide printer and multifunction printer market grew by double digits in the first quarter of 2014, reaching 37.65 million units — up 32.1 percent from the same period last year, according to market research firm <a href="http://www.idc.com" target="_blank">IDC's</a> Worldwide Quarterly Production Printer Tracker.</p>
<p>That growth followed decline of 9.3 percent in Q1 2013 from Q1 2012.</p>
<p>"The worldwide production market is on an upswing, as devices targeted at different segments of the market are finding good traction. The Mid-Production space is performing well in both color and monochrome, while Production devices, both toner and inkjet, are selling well as they continue along the offset transfer path and create brand new applications within digital. 2014 is shaping up to be an exciting year, falling in the mid-drupa cycle, and we expect to see lots of new technology introductions come to market that will drive investment," said Amy Machado, IDC senior research analyst, hardcopy peripheral solutions, in a prepared statement.</p>

<p>Sales of printers hit $1.1 billion in the quarter, up 14.4 percent from Q1 2013.</p>
<p>The strongest region was Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan), which saw growth in printers and MFPs of 29.7 percent, but the United States also saw significant growth: 18 percent.</p>
