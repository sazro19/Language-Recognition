<p>The 1-to-1 project at <a href="http://www.mantecausd.net/home" target="_blank">Manteca Unified School District</a> in the central valley of California might, on the face of it, look like many other similar initiatives. The network needed upgrading, the teachers needed training and student devices needed to be chosen. What sets it apart however, is how the district torqued every aspect of the endeavor to maximize the impact of its efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Leverage the New Infrastructure</strong><br/>
A big push for the school board to allocate $30 million to the district for this project was linked to the introduction of state online assessments tied to the Common Core learning standards. The work started with the building of wired and wireless network infrastructure, which took up the bulk of the budget — between $18 million and $19 million. Over five months the district's network supervisor designed, redesigned and tweaked the entire <a href="http://www.cisco.com/" target="_blank">Cisco</a>-based network, which now supports nearly 1,700 wireless access points in the district offices and campuses.</p>

<p>The infrastructure was also sturdy enough to support new additions. (This is where the extra torque comes in.) "Our digital project was about student devices and an infrastructure to put those student devices on," noted Manteca Superintendent Jason Messer. "We capitalized on that opportunity to do things like upgrade our phone system and to make sure our infrastructure was robust enough to start doing video surveillance for student safety as we move forward."</p>
<p><strong>Go Whole-Hog with Teacher Training</strong><br/>
By March 2014, teachers were outfitted with their devices: the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/products/surface-pro-2" target="_blank">Microsoft Surface Pro 2</a>, a two-in-one touch device that can be used as a laptop or as a tablet. Before a teacher could carry the computer away he or she attended three hours of staff development time, which was initially developed and delivered by a Microsoft education expert. By October and November almost every teacher had gone through that. In addition, teachers are required to get an additional nine hours of development training this year, which could come in multiple forms — online or in-person. But that's all standard.</p>
<p>What isn't standard is what comes next.</p>
<p>First, the district introduced "Cup O Joe" carts, which are rolled out to each school once a week. "You get a free cup of coffee and a half an hour of collaboration time," explained Messer. "We train two teachers at every school we call 'tech champions,' and those tech champions are just there to facilitate the collaboration and the learning for the teachers."<br/>

<p>Second, Manteca also hosted its first ever "Educator Conference." School was closed for an in-service day on a Monday in February and one of Manteca's high schools served as the setting for half a dozen keynoters, 67 15- to 45-minute breakout sessions, an expo hall, food and prizes for all educators. An on-site collaboration space allowed participants to earn credit by sharing with each other and watching district-made videos about how to implement various activities in the classroom.</p>
<p>Third, nearly every Monday night Manteca teachers get online to join the district <a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> chat at #ptbmtechchat ("proud to be Manteca Unified..."). Traffic was fairly slow until the district began offering credit for participation. Now "Teachers love the Twitter feeds," said Victoria Brunn, director of Community Outreach and Innovative Programs. Each week, the group tries to focus on a different topic, and frequently, guests are invited from tech companies or other sources to share advice.</p>
<p>During a recent chat, the topic was how parent communications change, Brunn noted. "Folks started to see, 'Wait a minute. Now I can set up a content library in my OneNote notebook on the device and parents can simply look at it and engage with me right there without pieces of paper getting shoved into the bottoms of backpacks.' It's important for us to be looking at all the ways that this kind of a project impacts everything, including communication."</p>
