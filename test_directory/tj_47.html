The
<a href="https://fpf.org/">Future
of Privacy Forum</a>
has long helped educators understand the privacy issues involved in
the technologies they rely on in their districts and schools.
Recently, Senior Counsel and Director of Youth &amp; Education
Privacy, Amelia Vance, talked with THE Journal about the new kinds of
concerns that have cropped up in an environment where virtual
teaching and learning has become the de facto form of education.</p>
<p>
The
interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>
<h3>
THE
Journal: Let's just talk about the disclosure of health information.
What are the main aspects to keep in mind there as schools are
putting together their plans and policies?</h3>
<p>
<strong>Amanda
Vance: </strong>When
it comes to reopening plans, we've seen a lot of schools pick up the
[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's] <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/index.html">guidelines</a>
or similar guidelines and try to implement them and build them into
their reopening policies, which makes a lot of sense. These are the
health experts, right? But they're not necessarily drilling down a
level and thinking about what it means when you collect health
information on a regular basis or when you require students or
parents or school staff to enter how they're feeling every day or
their health symptoms.</p>

What
information are you requiring people to turn over? Have you built a
system that incentivizes people to tell the truth? Are they going to
trust that the information that you're collecting is just to prevent
COVID-19 infections, that it's not going to be used to disadvantage
their child or harm or stigmatize their family within the community?
Are you keeping in mind the many symptoms that are similar to
COVID-19 or aspects of symptoms of COVID-19 that would indicate
pretty sensitive things? A high temperature could indicate that
someone recently had surgery, that they might be pregnant, that they
might have a sexually transmitted infection.</p>
<h3>
What do
you suggest they do?</h3>
<p>
There's no
super special formula here. It really goes back to the central
principles of privacy and fairness that have been around since at
least the 1970 s--and many of them way before then.</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://privacy.cornell.edu/fair-information-practice-principles/">Fair
Information Practice Principles</a>,
which were codified in part of the <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act</a>
and pretty much every federal agency and many state agencies and many
international laws, provides a basic framework for data governance.
It says four things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	That you
	should be transparent about what information is collected;</p>
</li><li>
<p>
	That you
	should make sure that information collected for one purpose will not
	be used for another purpose;</p>
</li><li>
<p>
	That there
	should be adequate security and that only the people who need access
	to the information will get it; and</p>
</li><li>
<p>
	That only
	the information that you need will be collected in the first place.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
There are
plenty of excellent resources for schools to adopt if they don't
already have a data governance plan. A new fabulous report on <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/forum/pub_2020083.asp">data
governance</a>
was just released from the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/forum/">National
Forum on Education Statistics</a>
that features case studies from state and local education agencies.</p>
<p>
There are so
many materials that schools can use. And it's not so much about doing
a detailed analysis. It's about asking the questions in the first
place and just going that level deeper as schools are creating their
plans that hinge on new data collection or adoption of technology:
What data? How is it going to be used? How will it be protected? How
will it be shared?</p>
