<p><a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/home.jsp" target="_blank">Gartner</a> has released its top 10 strategic predictions for 2016 and the near future.  This year's list highlights "smart" technologies, such as artificial  intelligence, and the relationships of humans to machines.</p>
<p>"The 'robo' trend, the emerging  practicality of artificial intelligence, and the fact that enterprises and  consumers are now embracing the advancement of these technologies is driving  change," said Daryl Plummer, vice president, distinguished analyst and  Gartner fellow, in a prepared statement. "Gartner's Top Predictions begin  to separate us from the mere notion of technology adoption and to draw us more  deeply into issues surrounding what it means to be human in a digital world."</p>
<p><strong>Machine-Authored Content</strong><br/>
Automated composition engines will increasingly  create data-based and analytical communications using natural language,  accounting for about one-fifth of business communications by 2018. "Business content, such as shareholder reports, legal  documents, market reports, press releases, articles and white papers, are all  candidates for automated writing tools," according to the company.</p>

<p><strong>Internet of Things  Will Demand IT Support</strong><br/>
Also  by 2018, the number of Internet-connected devices will swell to approximately 6  billion. Thone newly online devices will generate support requests, requiring  IT organizations to develop new strategies dealing specifically with solving  their problems.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomous Software  Agents Will Make Economic Transactions</strong><br/>
By  the end of the decade, one in 20 economic transactions will include at least  one "algorithmically driven agent" that will "hold value"  itself, according to Gartner. "We  will see algorithms," according to a news release, "often developed  in a transparent, open-source fashion and set free on the blockchain, capable  of banking, insurance, markets, exchanges, crowdfunding — and virtually all  other types of financial instruments."</p>
<p><strong>Rise of the  Robo-Bosses</strong><br/>
Approximately  3 million workers globally will be supervised by some kind of machine manager  making decisions based on performance measurements. Such decisions will include  issues like staffing requirements and management incentives.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Vandalism</strong><br/>
By  the end of 2018 one in five smart buildings will have experienced some kind of  digital vandalism. "With  exploits ranging from defacing digital signage to plunging whole buildings into  prolonged darkness, digital vandalism is a nuisance, rather than a threat,"  according to a news release. "There are, nonetheless, economic, health and  safety, and security consequences. The severity of these consequences depend on  the target. Smart building components cannot be considered independently, but  must be viewed as part of the larger organizational security process. Products  must be built to offer acceptable levels of protection and hooks for  integration into security monitoring and management systems."</p>
<p><strong>Rise of the  Robo-Workers</strong><br/>
By  2018 nearly half, 45 percent, of the fastest-growing companies will have more  smart machines than human employees. Startups and other new companies will be  the first to leverage smart machines effectively and quickly, according to  Gartner. "The speed, cost  savings, productivity improvements and ability to scale of smart technology for  specific tasks offer dramatic advantages over the recruiting, hiring, training  and growth demands of human labor," according to information released by  the company. Examples provided by Gartner include drone-only surveillance  services and fully automated grocery stores.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Assistants</strong><br/>
Digital  assistants capable of recognizing individuals by face or voice recognition will  mimic human conversation to provide customer support. These assistants will be  able to listen, speak, maintain a sense of history and context and use timing  and tone to interact with customers.</p>
<p><strong>Employee Health  Tracking</strong><br/>
By  2018 approximately 2 million employees will be required to wear a health or  fitness tracking device globally. "Emergency responders, such as police officers, firefighters and  paramedics, will likely comprise the largest group of employees required to  monitor their health or fitness with wearables," according to a news  release. "The primary reason for wearing them is for their own safety."</p>
<p><strong>Smart Agents</strong><br/>
By the end of the decade smart agents, such as virtual  personal assistants, will combine user content and behavior with cloud-based  neural networks to build models that will predict user needs, eventually acting  on the user's behalf.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Security Failures</strong><br/>
Through the end of the decade, nearly all cloud  security incidents, 95 percent, will be the fault of customers and not the  result of vulnerabilities. </p>
