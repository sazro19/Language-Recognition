<p><a href="http://www.mojonetworks.com/" target="_blank">Mojo Networks</a>,
a provider of secure cloud-managed Wi-Fi for the K-12 education market,
has introduced a new network authentication tool designed to make it
easier for school IT administrators to control Wi-Fi device connections.</p>
<p>Currently,
schools have two main options for authenticating devices on Wi-Fi
networks: pre-shared key (PSK) or 802.1x. According to information from
Mojo Networks, both methods have their limitations — PSK passphrases
are easily shared, and 802.1x is expensive and typically requires an
on-premises appliance. Furthermore, neither method allows network
administrators to control which devices can connect to the network.</p>
<p>Mojo Networks has developed Mojo Enforce, a new tool designed to solve these challenges. Mojo Enforce integrates with <a href="https://www.google.com/edu/" target="_blank">Google for Education</a> to provide "an additional layer of authentication above PSK or 802.1x,
providing administrators the control to define what devices connect to
the network," according to a news release. Mojo Enforce works with the
school's existing Mojo Wi-Fi network without the need for additional
licenses, on-premises appliances or client or network re-configuration.
The company plans integration with other third-party systems in the
future.</p>

<p>According to information from the company, Mojo Enforce
works by using Mojo Cloud to fetch the list of enrolled devices from
the school or district's Google for Education account, and Mojo Cloud
sends the list to all Mojo cloud-managed access points. Devices can
then use either PSK or 802.1x to attempt to connect to the network. If
the device is authorized, the access point assigns it a role or network
policy based on the device's organizational unit membership. If the
device is unauthorized, the access point denies the connection.</p>
<p>Mojo
Enforce currently integrates with Google for Education, and the company
plans to integrate with other third-party systems beginning in 2017.
The open beta test of Mojo Enforce will begin in the third quarter of
2016, and customers can sign up to participate on the Mojo Networks
site. The company expects to release Mojo Enforce in the fourth quarter
of 2016.</p>
