<p><a href="https://www.watchguard.com/" target="_blank">WatchGuard</a> has launched <a href="https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-products/dnswatchgo" target="_blank">DNSWatchGo</a> to help educators protect themselves from cyber attacks. The new cloud-based service automatically detects and blocks phishing attacks, command and control callbacks and data exfiltration attempts against users.  </p>
<p>DNSWatchGo provides individuals with "DNS-level protection and content filtering" outside the classroom and school environment. It also gives educators information on how to protect themselves against future security incidents.</p>
<p>Key features of the solution include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protection on the go to monitor and correlate outbound DNS requests from off-network users into an aggregated list of malicious domains.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Immediate security education to inform users on phishing attacks in real-time and provide them with resources for best practices to avoid them.</li>
