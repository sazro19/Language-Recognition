<p><a href="http://www.magnoliaisd.org/" target="_blank">Magnolia Independent School District</a> (ISD) in Magnolia, TX has selected an enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution that centralizes finance, human resources and student information. </p>
<p>The district selected <a href="https://teams.solutions/" target="_blank">TEAMS ERP</a> from <a href="https://teams.solutions/about/" target="_blank">Prologic Technology Systems</a>, a provider of intelligent education software solutions based in Austin. </p>
<p>"TEAMS is an all-in-one school management system that will give us efficiencies in all areas of operations, from automating complex human resources processes, to building district budgets and managing student information,” said Magnolia ISD Superintendent Todd Stephens, in a prepared statement from Prologic. “We are excited to partner with TEAMS as they offered us the best complete solution that meets the goals of our district.”</p>
<p>The system gives administrators a single, complete database that is updated in real-time. HR staff at schools, for example, can use TEAMS to track all incoming, outgoing and current staffing changes for reporting. Administrators have reported cost savings through TEAMS, with less paperwork, workflow processes and personnel needed after implementation. With the mobile app, parents and teachers can stay connected on school matters (such as attendance, grades, etc.).   </p>

<p>In addition, the web-based solution includes single sign-on capability and custom reporting. </p>
<p>“We wanted a system that was fully automated and intuitive that allows us to quickly export data for state and local reporting purposes," said Erich Morris, assistant superintendent of operation at Magnolia ISD, in the statement. </p>
