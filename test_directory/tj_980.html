<p> Desktops aren't dead. Even as schools increasingly implement 1-to-1, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) and other mobile device initiatives, many are choosing to retain at least some desktop computers — and others are even upgrading to swanky, top-of-the-line machines. Keeping at least one desktop computer in each classroom is a common practice, and some schools are keeping their dedicated desktop labs, either for general use or for specialized classes. It seems that some classroom needs are still better served by a desktop computer than by a laptop or tablet. Here, school technology leaders from around the country share  reasons why you might want to keep at least some desktop computers around.</p>
<p><strong>1) Processor Power</strong></p>
<p>Schools that offer classes in video editing, engineering or CAD drawing need computers with scads of power because the software required for those classes is processor-intensive. For instance, <a href="http://www.chicousd.org/" target="_blank">Chico Unified School District</a> (California) has labs for AutoCAD and video production classes that are outfitted with high-end desktops. According to Jason Gregg, director of information services for the district, "Although you can buy laptops that are able to run that software, they're a lot more expensive, so that's definitely a place where it's more cost-effective to have desktop computers." </p>

<p><strong>2) Screen Size</strong></p>
<p>The classes that benefit from the powerful processors also tend to benefit from large computer screens. John Orbaugh, executive director of technology at <a href="http://www.tylerisd.org/" target="_blank">Tyler Independent School District</a> (Texas), said, "If I'm sitting down in an AutoCAD lab, I don't want to really do that much AutoCAD on a laptop screen, I want a 24-inch monitor in front of me where I can have a little more screen real estate to work on my project, or if I'm editing video I want to have a little more space than I would find on the typical laptop." </p>
<p> In video editing or CAD drawing classes, it's important for students to be able to see the visual details of their work, and larger screens make that easier. And while it's possible to connect a larger external monitor to  laptops, districts find that it's often more practical and cost-effective to stick with desktop computer for those situations.</p>
<p><strong>3) Ergonomics</strong></p>
<p>Screen size is essentially an ergonomic issue, but it's not the only one. Some schools are sticking with desktops so they have more control over the placement of the monitor and keyboard, and to provide students with full-sized keyboards with integrated number pads. Phil Hardin, recently retired executive director of technology at <a href="http://www.rss.k12.nc.us/" target="_blank">Rowan-Salisbury School System</a> in Salisbury, North Carolina, said,  "Dealing with spreadsheets and numbers is inefficient on a typical laptop or iPad-type keyboard. We use the extended keyboards on our desktops so students have the numeric keypad there on the side."</p>
<p> Susan Plante is a teacher and the director of technology at <a href="http://www.eaglehillsouthport.org/" target="_blank">Eagle Hill Southport</a>, a school in Southport, Connecticut for students with learning disabilities. She said some of her students find it easier to work with a full-sized monitor and keyboard and to use a mouse. The separate keyboard also makes it easier to teach typing skills, in Plante's opinion. "I focus on kids with learning disabilities, but I think teaching typing is so beneficial for any student in today's world," she said. "It is so much harder to teach them to type when things are all connected. We want them not to look at the keyboard and we want them to look at the screen. It's so much more challenging to say don't look when everything's all connected, whether it be a tablet or a laptop."</p>
