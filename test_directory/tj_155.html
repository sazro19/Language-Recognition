When Donna Williamson began her career as an  educational technology director 30 years ago, she taught multiple  technology-related courses every day and provided professional development for  teachers, on top of her responsibilities managing the district's technology  with little-to-no assistance. Since then, she has seen technology departments  expand to support the ever-increasing demands of ed-tech initiatives. </p>
<p>
"The role has become more of one of  leadership, vision. As recently as five years ago, the CTO in a K-12 school was  the person who was providing solutions," she said. "And now, it's  more about coaching your administrators, your teachers, with those executive  coaching skills, that brings out the solution from them."</p>
<p>
<em>THE Journal</em> spoke recently with Williamson and  four other district technology leaders about the changing role of the CTO in  the current era of STEM and STEAM. Those district technology leaders include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diane Doersch, chief technology  and information officer, Green Bay Area Public School District in Green Bay,  WI;</li>
<li>Phil Hintz, director of  technology, Gurnee School District in Gurnee, IL;</li>
<li>Adam Phyall, director of  technology and Media Services, Newton County School System in Covington, GA;</li>
<li>Joel VerDuin, chief technology and  information officer, Anoka-Hennepin School District in Anoka, MN; and </li>
<li>Donna Williamson, technology  director at Mountain Brook Schools in Birmingham, AL.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>THE  Journal: How has the role of the K-12 chief technology officer changed over the  last 20-or-so years?</strong></p>
<div class="calloutImgRightHalf" type="CallOut"><img alt="Diane Doersch, chief technology and information officer, Green Bay Area Public School District in Green Bay, WI" height="240" src="/-/media/EDU/THEJournal/2018-Images/20180131ctoDoersch_Diane.jpg" width="300"/>
<p>Diane Doersch, chief technology  and information officer, Green Bay Area Public School District in Green Bay,  WI</p>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Diane Doersch</strong>: I've really seen a  transformation from the technical side to the ed tech side, and now it's coming  even to the policy side. Because as we've made our move to the cloud, we're  having to pay more attention to FERPA, HIPAA, cloud storage, security  agreements, student data privacy and security, helping our staff and students  understand phishing scams, and really helping to build secure environment for  our kids to work in. </p>
<p>
<strong>Phil Hintz</strong>: Technology has become so pervasive  across the entire district, in every area, whether it be physical education  class, or HVAC systems, or you name it, technology is in everything we do in a  school district. Even on the buses, putting WiFi on school buses, tracking  buses with GPS. And that's the change that has occurred over the last 20 years,  is that it's just in everything anybody does.</p>
<p>
<strong>Joel VerDuin</strong>: I think one of the biggest  differences is that need to be a partner, keeping an eye on the objectives of  the organization and finding out where they can help, as opposed to being a  driver for things…. Sometimes we have to drive just to make sure that we're in  the right conversations and inputting the right visibility around some of the  trends that are coming. But I don't find that I'm working as much on technology  initiatives that I feel like we need to do as an organization. I find myself  partnering and helping other people move their missions along much further.</p>
<p>
<strong>THE  Journal: What can the K-12 CTO do to enable the latest trends in education?</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>Doersch</strong>: We take away a lot of the routine  things by building digital environments that are easy for our students and our  staff to access. We incorporate single sign-on as much as we can. We try to  automate tasks. We run batches of data behind the scenes so our teachers are  always working with the most up-to-date data. All those types of things to  build efficiencies…. Because of that, we hope that our staff and our students  will have more opportunities to be innovative. And innovative means being able  to try things, fail at things, revise things, try again, all those things that  are real-life skills.</p>
