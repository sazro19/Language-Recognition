<p>About 12,000 students who possess individualized education  programs (IEPs) had personal information posted to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/s3o0tmubftxp2qc/AABrAHrYtlTEBi6TnDWsan28a?dl=0" target="_blank">a  public Dropbox site</a> attending schools in Washington, D.C. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/dc-accidentally-uploads-private-information-of-12000-students/2016/02/11/7618c698-d0ff-11e5-abc9-ea152f0b9561_story.html" target="_blank">Reporting  by the Washington Post</a> said the data was inadvertently made available  online "for several hours" on Tuesday and has since been taken down.  The file with the private information was uploaded to the cloud-based file  storage site prior to a meeting about the program that manages the IEPs. The  file included names, schools, identification numbers and other personal details  about each student, including his or her disability and what special services  they use.</p>
<p>The announcement came from the district's <a href="http://osse.dc.gov/" target="_blank">Office of the State Superintendent of Education</a>,  which handles federal grants, compliance with federal laws and other governance  activities for area students. According to the Post, Hanseul Kang, the state  superintendent of education, issued a "letter to colleagues" in which  she stated, "Our families deserve to know that their students' personal  information is being kept confidential and secure in the education  system."</p>

<p>Just about a year ago the <a href="http://dcps.dc.gov/" target="_blank">District  of Columbia Public Schools</a> suffered a different kind of exposure of special  education student information. The district realized that an internal Web site  launched in 2010 that stored training materials for district staff included  login information that would enable anybody to access a database containing  information about special ed students. The district found no evidence that  anybody has actually viewed the data. At that time, the district issued <a href="http://dcps.dc.gov/release/statement-dcps-chief-specialized-instruction-dr-nathaniel-beers-regarding-special-education" target="_blank">a  statement</a> apologizing for the breach: "We understand how important it  is to safeguard student information and will conduct a top-to-bottom review of  our security practices to ensure this does not happen again."</p>
<p>Then in March 2015, the Office of the State Superintendent  of Education reported that it had "inadvertently" released student  data in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. The disclosed data  included student names, birth dates, grade levels, gender, race, ethnicity,  English language learner classification, non-public attendance, special ed  status, school of attendance, details related to suspensions and expulsions and  student identifiers. In that situation the data was actually redacted and the  file locked when it was sent to the FOIA recipient; however, the office later  found out that the file could be unlocked, exposing the personal information.</p>
<p>In none of these cases were Social Security numbers involved.</p>
