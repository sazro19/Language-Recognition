<p><a href="teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">Treehouse</a>, an online digital platform designed to help people learn how to use digital tools, has introduced a series of video courses to teach people how to write code for Swift, the programming language Apple introduced for iOS and OS X development at its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc" target="_blank">Worldwide Developers Conference</a> in June. At the same time, Treehouse introduced an Android app that will provide more access to its more than 1,000 course videos.</p>
<p>According to Treehouse, this is one of the first video-based, self-paced learning courses dealing with Swift designed for beginning coders. Made up of 71 instructional videos, there are four different courses to help students quickly master Apple's new coding language.</p>
<p>Treehouse officials say that students with no prior programming experience who spend about five hours a week on the courses can learn the language in about a month.</p>
<p>"Since Swift is a new language to everyone — even to advanced developers — this creates new opportunities and levels the playing field for students and developers," said Amit Bijlani, Treehouse Swift program creator. "If you've ever wanted to build an iOS app or raise your visibility as a developer, now is the time to learn the language."</p>

<p>At the same time Treehouse introduced the course on Swift coding, it also announced that all of its courses are now available on an Android app. Previously available for iPads, about 130,000 apps have been downloaded in the last year.</p>
<p>Consequently, via iPad or Android downloads, more than 1,000 course videos with instruction on Web design, coding, app development and business applications are available that also give students full-screen videos, transcripts and teaching notes.</p>
<p>"With two mobile versions now available, we're giving our students the opportunity to learn wherever or whenever they choose," said Joe Steele, Treehouse Android application developer.</p>
<p>Student quizzes, practice exercises and challenges are available to help students retain information and a customized keyboard gives them access to special keys when writing code. As Treehouse students learn different coding concepts, they can earn badges and become certified Treehouse Verified coders, information they can share with potential employers.</p>
