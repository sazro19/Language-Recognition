<p>Balefire Labs has added Android apps to its <a href="http://www.balefirelabs.com/apps/" target="_blank">app review service</a>, bringing the  total number of reviewed apps to more than 3,000, in an effort to better serve  classrooms with bring-your-own-device programs. Previously, the company only  included reviews for apps for iOS devices.</p>
<p>"We know that BYOD programs comprise the fastest-growing  segment of mobile technology in public schools today," said Karen L. Mahon,  president and founder of Balefire Labs, in a prepared statement. "Many  schools are opting to allow students to use their own mobile devices in class  and teachers of those classes struggle to find high quality instructional apps  that can be used by all of their students, regardless of the platform their  devices use. We think this is a giant step toward helping those teachers more  quickly and easily find the best resources for their learners, without having  to search multiple websites."</p>
<p>To navigate the multiple operating systems and app outlets,  the service's Web interface now includes the ability to search by store and  limit results to those found on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes or any combination  of the three.</p>

<p>"We have added more than 1,000 app reviews  for Android with this launch" said Mahon, ina  news release. "And because we are seeing  more and more educational apps that are available for multiple platforms, we  expect that we will be able to add substantially to our collections of reviews  for both platforms over the coming months. With the new software tools that are  now available, developers are more readily able to build cross-platform apps  than ever before and we see an increasing number of them taking advantage of  that."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.balefirelabs.com/apps/?page_id=3803" target="_blank">Individual subscriptions</a> for the app review services are $3.99 per month or $39.99 per year, with free two-day  trials available. School site licenses, with unlimited users, are available for  $499.</p>
