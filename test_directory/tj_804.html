<p><a href="http://www.princetonk12.org/" target="_blank">Princeton Public Schools</a> in New
Jersey has upgraded to a 500 megabit-per-second (Mbps) dedicated business-class
Internet connection to support the district's increasing use of online resources
and assessments.</p>
<p>The district is home to one preschool, four elementary schools, one middle
school and one high school, serving approximately 3,500 students and employing
more than 350 faculty and staff. As with many other districts, Princeton Public
Schools has been using more cloud-based resources in recent years, and since New
Jersey is a governing state in the <a href="http://www.parcconline.org/" target="_blank"> Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers</a> (PARCC)
Consortium, its schools need reliable high-speed Internet connections to conduct
online assessments.</p>
<p>In early October, the district implemented a <a href="http://www.sunesys.com/internet-services/" target="_blank">Sunesys SunIP</a> Internet
connectivity and transport solution. According to a news release from the
company, the connection "provides 500 Mbps up and down from Princeton's hub
location back to two northeast-based data centers" in Newark, NJ and
Philadelphia, PA. The service offers dynamic routing between multiple Tier 1
providers, as well as "primary or secondary DNS, IP addresses controlled by ARIN
guidelines and a dedicated customer portal for monitoring."</p>

<p>"The diverse connection helps to reduce potential points of failure and the
robust fiber optic transport connects directly back to our network backbone,"
said Peter C. Thompson, manager of information technology at Princeton Public
Schools, in a prepared statement. "With Princeton's increasing reliance on cloud
based resources and the growth of online assessment and testing such as PARCC,
we are meeting the demand of technology needs for our students and faculty."</p>
