<p>A North  Carolina school district was hit with the Emotet virus, crippling its network  infrastructure. Last week, <a href="https://www.rock.k12.nc.us/" target="_blank">Rockingham County School District</a> Superintendent Rodney Shotwell  held a press conference, in which he described how the district fell victim to  a computer malware attack through users clicking on infected EXE files in their  e-mail, under the subject heading, "Incorrect invoice." Clean-up is  expected to cost $314,000.</p>
<p>Emotet,  according to security firm <a href="https://community.sophos.com/kb/en-us/127218" target="_blank">Sophos</a>,  is an advanced network worm that drops "malicious payloads onto target  computers." It's designed to steal a user's online banking details, and  stopping it requires "every machine on the infected network to be  protected with anti-virus."</p>
<p>The first  clue that something was wrong at Rockingham came when Google disabled certain  e-mail accounts because they were producing spam e-mails. That was followed by  reports from users who couldn't connect to the internet through their web  browsers. Malware mitigation and clean-up began at that time.</p>

<p>During the  press conference, Shotwell explained that even after all of the infected computers  at the district were cleaned and re-imaged, they became re-infected. At that  point the district IT team called in the cavalry, including the U.S. Federal  Bureau of Investigation, as well as local IT experts.</p>
<p>Rockingham  also began working with <a href="http://www.prologicits.com/" target="_blank">ProLogic ITS</a> for virus mitigation services for  about a dozen servers and 3,000 client machines. While the $314,000 contract  with the IT consultancy will bring in 10 engineers for a total of about 1,200  on-site hours, according to reporting by <a href="http://www.greensboro.com/rockingham_now/news/email-virus-shuts-down-rockingham-county-schools-computer-servers/article_7513dbba-ec0b-11e7-8d14-bff0d0ddfcf5.html" target="_blank">Rockingham Now</a>, it will also pay for ongoing  virus mitigation services for the next year.</p>
<p>"It's  like a disease," said Shotwell. "We're trying to quarantine it. Right  now, there's not a software out there for this malware that will enable you to  clean the device and ensure that it won't come back." Even though the  school system has used antivirus software for a "very long time" and  updated its systems, the malware is designed to find those computers that  haven't been updated and exploit them.</p>
<p>On the  positive side, Shotwell added, the antivirus capabilities did "chew up the  ransomware where it did not activate." As a result, "our data was  never compromised because of ransomware. Our data was protected and  saved."</p>
