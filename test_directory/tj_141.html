<p>For technology professionals, education has been a rewarding  place to work over the last year. Salaries are up for the most part; job  satisfaction is high; and the outlook for the future is positive — these according  to the results of our third-annual K–12 IT Salary &amp; Job Satisfaction Survey.</p>
<h3>Salaries</h3>
<p>
Overall, the average salary for technology professional in  education (excluding classroom teachers) was $66,640 in 2017 — up about $3,000  from 2015 (<a href="/-/media/edu/thejournal/2018-images/20180524fig1large.jpg">fig. 1, click to enlarge</a>).</p>

While C-level salaries were up on the whole ($100,400 in  2017 versus $99,045 in 2015), CIO salaries themselves declined from $105,469 in  2015 to an even $100,000 in 2017. That, however, is a slight recovery from  2016's average of $99,583. (C-level includes CIO, CSO, CTO and CDO.)</p>
<p>
Project managers and help desk/support staff salaries took a  hit in this year's survey as well. Project managers declined to $70,636, down  from $74,940 in 2015. Help desk/support fell slightly over the same period,  from $41,425 to $40,410.</p>
<p>
The most substantial positive jumps over the two-year period  were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Systems administrators, who leapt more than  $18,000 — from $60,035 to $78,800;</li>
<li>Web developers, who climbed $17,000 from $58,000  to $75,192; and</li>
<li>Database administrators, who jumped nearly $13,000  from $76,436 to $87,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the broader categories (<a href="/-/media/edu/thejournal/2018-images/20180524fig2large.jpg">fig. 2, click to enlarge</a>), several even more  substantial jumps were seen over the last two years. </p>
<ul>
<li>The average for those in systems analysis went  from $41,938 in 2015 to $74,664 in 2017, a gain of more than $32,000;</li>
<li>Applications and development staff saw an  increase of $22,000, from $57,256 in 2015 to $79,650 in 2017;</li>
<li>Web/digital media staff rose about $19,000, from  $58,633 to $77,667; and</li>
<li>Database/business intelligence staff rose almost  $15,000, from $76,436 in 2015 to $91,333 in 2017.</li>
</ul>

" height="253" src="/-/media/EDU/THEJournal/2018-Images/20180524fig2644.jpg" width="644"/></a> </p>
<p>Respondents from the smallest schools or systems (0–499  students) had the lowest overall weighted average salary, at $59,456 ($58,874  at small private schools, $59,731 at small public schools). Employees at the  largest schools (3,000 or more students) had the highest weighted average  salary: $79,552 ($77,742 private, $80,300 public).</p>
<p>
Elementary schools had the lowest salaries on average —  $60,161 for tech pros in public elementary schools (excluding teachers) and  $52,700 in private elementary schools. The average for public secondary schools  was $62,604 and, for private secondary schools, $62,926. Those at public  combined elementary came in at an average of $73,225. Private combined schools  came in at an average tech salary of $70,206, excluding teachers.</p>
<h3>
Job Satisfaction</h3>
<p>
Technology professionals in education are, for the most  part, quite satisfied with their jobs. About 84 percent plan to stay in their  current position in the coming year (<a href="/-/media/edu/thejournal/2018-images/20180524fig7.jpg">fig. 7</a>), with just 16 percent expecting to  leave their current employer. That's not terribly surprising, given that a  majority of respondents have been with their present employer for 11 or more  years, with a full 20 percent at 21-plus years (<a href="/-/media/edu/thejournal/2018-images/20180524fig4.jpg">fig. 4</a>).</p>
