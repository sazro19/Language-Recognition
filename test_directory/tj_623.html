<p>Does educational technology close the achievement gap or widen it? Even in the best-case scenarios, when the potential of digital learning is fulfilled and all student achievement increases, the gap is likely to increase. Why? As Tom Vander Ark points out in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Smart-Digital-Learning-Changing/dp/1118007239" target="_blank"><em>Getting Smart</em></a>, when we use ed tech to raise the floor for student achievement, the ceiling is raised even further. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, educational technology leaders often see only the best-case scenario. In reality, when the achievement gap increases, sometimes it is because the absolute performance improvements may be limited to select students due to a number of factors.</p>
<p>First, many describe digital learning as an amplifier of teaching, especially in our increasingly mobile world. Great teachers accomplish amazing things with this technology, guiding students to cognitive improvements and increased self-efficacy. Unfortunately, poor teaching is also amplified. In the hands of unskilled teachers, technology can actually decrease student performance.</p>

<p>Second, the promise of 1-to-1 and bring your own device (BYOD) strategies enables changes in teaching and learning. Yet in all too many implementations, teachers use these new technologies to support traditional teaching methods: PDFs replace textbooks, apps replace worksheets, PowerPoint presentations replace poster boards and the Internet replaces library searches. The classroom structure, however, remains unchanged. Without changing teaching and learning, student outcomes don't improve as compared to those implementations where authentic student-centered techniques leverage technology to shift teaching and learning. </p>
<p>Third, while school culture has a critical impact on whether educational technology is accessible and how it is used, so does home culture. In many communities, particularly those with high immigrant populations, a distrust of technology and government oversight limits technology use in the home. In some lower-income families, parents can only offer limited support after school hours, and often create a home culture in which academic achievement isn't valued. This home culture gap gives students whose parents are supportive and knowledgeable about technologu an advantage over those who don't. </p>
<p>Fourth, the homework gap affects both individual students and entire classrooms and buildings. Several studies have indicated that more than 75 percent of teachers assign homework that requires the Internet. This puts students without home access at a disadvantaged, and also puts the burden on teachers to find a way to allow those students to complete homework without the Web. This has a dual impact: The additional time and resources required to support two homework mechanisms are costly; and if one student does not have technology in the home, teachers are constrained from shifting their teaching to the new pedagogies that depend on connectivity in the home to raise student achievement.</p>
<p>Finally, there is an inequity beyond the homework gap that is seldom considered as part of the national connectivity conversation. The 2010 National Educational Technology Plan called for "anytime, anywhere" learning for students. Today, there is a "mobility gap" between those students who have access to cellular broadband 24/7 and those who don't.</p>
<p>Having even a single student who lacks home broadband access perpetuates the homework gap. When student can't rely on adequate Internet access, they must continue to support old work habits and processes in addition to the new, digitally based processes. Of course, not all schoolwork will be digital, but for those learning experiences that are, a lack of access is costly.</p>
