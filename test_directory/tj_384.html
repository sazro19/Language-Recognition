<p>Salaries are up, and so is the level of optimism for the
future among IT pros in K–12 education. According to
THE Journal's second-annual IT Salary &amp; Job Satisfaction Survey, the overall average salary for IT leaders and
workers grew about $2,000 year over year. The vast
majority also told us they see nothing but healthy or even unbridled growth in the future for IT in academia.</p>
<h3>Salaries</h3>
<p>
The overall average salary for IT professionals in education — excluding teachers who have a dual role in technology — came in at $65,742. (See figure 1.) That's roughly $2,000 higher than last year's overall average. (If we include teachers who participated in the survey, the average comes down a bit to $64,499, but still higher than last year's overall average of $63,776.)</p>

C-level leadership remains at the top of the salary heap, averaging about $102,000 — up about $3,000 from last year. Other IT leaders, including directors, vice presidents, managers and the like, came in second at an average of $76,806, an increase of about $3,800 over last year's reported average. Coming in third were database/business intelligence staff at $75,449, a drop of about $1,000 from last year. </p>
<p>
The only grouped category (figure 2) to see a decline this year besides database/business intelligence staff was network/data center/security staff, which fell off by a whopping $9,600 to land at $51,154.</p>

The most substantial year-over-year gains were seen by developers, systems analysis staff and trainers. Technology trainers' average salary climbed about $6,000 to hit $61,195 this year. The average salary for K–12 software developers jumped more than $8,000 to $65,333. But systems analysis staff, which included analysts and senior analysts, left them both in the dust, jumping more than $14,000 to reach $56,000. (See figure 2.)</p>

<p>
There was a near-linear progression in overall unweighted average salaries based on institution size, with smaller institutions generally seeing lower salaries than large ones. The exception, as with last year's results, was the category of schools with 2,000 to 2,999 students, in which salaries came in lower than those of IT pros in smaller institutions.</p>
<p>
Excluding salaries from respondents with "teacher" in their job description, the smallest schools (those with fewer than 500 students) had an average reported IT salary of $54,116 ($55,755 with teacher salaries averaged in); in schools with 500 to 999 students, the average IT salary was $55,900 ($55,356 with teacher salaries); in schools with 1,000 to 1,499 students, the average salary was $66,256 ($65,191 including teacher salaries); in schools with 1,500 to 1,999 students, the average was $73,804 ($69,469 including teachers); in schools with 2,000 to 2,999 students, the average IT salary was $66,840 ($69,583 with teachers); and in schools with 3,000 or more students,
the average was $78,831 ($77,725 with
teachers factored in).</p>
