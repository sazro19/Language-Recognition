<p>Educational services company Kaplan has teamed up with Microsoft to create <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/core-score/1c509148-586b-4d01-ada1-54d96d249e93" target="_blank">Core Score</a>, a free app for Windows devices that provides students in grades three through eight with grade-appropriate math practice questions created for the Common Core State Standards. As students solve problems, the app provides them with answers and detailed explanations designed to encourage independent skill practice and mastery. </p>
<p>The app also offers built-in tools to help teachers monitor student performance and usage. Teachers can view math problems by standard and preview the questions, answers and explanations their students receive. Teachers with registered accounts can administer five-question math practice sets across the grade-level standards.</p>
<p>The Core Score app was developed using <a href="http://www.learningpod.com/" target="_blank">Learningpod</a>, Kaplanâ€™s open content platform, which provides practice questions for educators and students.</p>
