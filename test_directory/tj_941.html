<p><a href="https://www.barracuda.com/" target="_blank">Barracuda Networks</a> has launched
Barracuda Mobile Device Manager (MDM), a free cloud-based iOS device and
application management service for Barracuda customers.</p>
<p>According to the company, Barracuda MDM helps K-12 schools provide
centralized administration and monitoring of iOS mobile devices. It's accessible
through the Barracuda Cloud Control portal and integrates with security and
storage solutions from the company.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barracuda-mobile-companion/id806338672?mt=8" target="_blank">
Barracuda Mobile Device Companion</a> app is also available from the Apple
Store. The app works with Barracuda MDM and can be used to enroll devices. "Once
enrolled, the devices can be centrally configured with security settings and
restrictions, remotely monitored and tracked if allowed as well as locked or
wiped in case of theft or loss," according to the company.</p>
<p>Stephen Pao, general manager of security for Barracuda, sees the solution as a "natural
progression" for the company, "providing a simple, easy-to-use and affordable
way for customers to extend their content and network security policies right
down to their mobile users," he said in a prepared statement.</p>
