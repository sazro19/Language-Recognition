<p><a href="http://www.pearsonschoolsystems.com/" target="_blank">Pearson</a> has partnered with <a href="https://www.tools4ever.com/" target="_blank">Tools4ever</a> to provide  identity and password management within its <a href="http://www.pearsonschoolsystems.com/products/powerschool/" target="_blank">PowerSchool</a> student information system (SIS).</p>
<p>The result of an independent software vendor (ISV) agreement,  the new collaboration will allow Tools4ever to provide a connection to its <a href="https://www.tools4ever.com/software/user-management-resource-administrator/" target="_blank">User  Management Resource Administrator</a> (UMRA) through PowerSchool.</p>
<p>The partnership is designed to reduce turnaround time on the  creation, approval and provisioning of accounts for various applications,  email, file systems and learning environments at the beginning of each school  year.</p>
<p>"This connection allows school districts to  automate and streamline identity management, which reduces the time and  resources their IT departments spend dealing with account management issues,"  according to a news release. "Specifically, system administrators can  automate the creation, movement and de-provisioning of employee and student  accounts in Active Directory, Google and Office 365 as well as cafeteria,  e-learning, transportation, library and other systems. As a result, no manual  action is needed for user account lifecycle management."</p>
