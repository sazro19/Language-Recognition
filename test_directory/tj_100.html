The major challenges facing technology adoption in education haven’t
changed much over the years. But the priorities of school and
district technology leaders have.</p>
<p>
According to a survey released this week by the <a href="https://cosn.org/">Consortium
for School Networking</a> (CoSN), the key challenges facing ed tech
have remained consistent for the last three year. Those are, in order
of priority:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
	Budget constraints (the top barrier in six out of the last seven IT
	surveys conducted by CoSN);</p>
</li><li>
<p>
	Lack of availability of relevant professional development/training;
	and</p>
</li><li>
<p>
	The existence of silos, making effective communication difficult.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
According to CoSN, the budget and professional development
constraints are intimately linked and cut across departments:
“Budgets are also directly linked to professional development (PD),
which is the number two challenge on the list. In the open-ended
answer section of the survey, respondents were asked about areas in
which they wished they had more time; they cited the need for PD for
all stakeholders — administrators, teachers, IT staff, as well as
the IT Leaders themselves.”</p>

Meanwhile, the top priorities for technology leaders have shifted.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	Ranking first in this year ‘s survey was data security (aka
	cybersecurity), up from second place last year and third place the
	year before.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
	“Cost-effective/smart budgeting” came in second. This priority
	didn’t make the list in previous surveys.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
	Data-driven instruction and decision-making was the third-highest
	priority in 2019, as it was in the previous year’s survey.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
According to CoSN: “For the second straight year, cybersecurity has
the top spot on IT Leaders’ technology priority list. At a time
when school districts are collecting greater amounts of data, threats
to the security of that data are also increasing. Since 2016, there
have been over 400 reported K-12 cybersecurity incidents. IT Leaders
are well aware that their institutions are faced with the same
challenges as the corporate sector, but risks in K-12 may actually be
higher. According to a recent report, educational institutions are
specifically being targeted by global cybercrime organizations….”</p>
<p>
The results were released during <a href="https://cosnconference.org/">CoSN's annual conference</a>, taking place this week in Portland, OR. The complete report is freely available at <a href="https://www.cosn.org/focus-areas/leadership-vision/it-leadership-survey">cosn.org</a>.</p>
