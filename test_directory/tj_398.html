<p><a href="http://maxst.com" target="_blank">Maxst</a>, a Seoul, South Korea-based augmented reality (AR) company, is introducing two new AR products Thursday at the <a href="http://www.ces.tech" target="_blank">International Consumer Electronics Show</a> (CES) in Las Vegas. This year’s convention runs Jan. 5-8.</p>
<p>Vivar is an AR-based video call platform that allows the sharing of 3D contents, video clips and images during a call. Vivar also features a drawing function which allows users to view AR drawings simultaneously. As one user draws on a screen, the other user(s) can see the drawing being made to scale in real time. </p>
<p>The second product Maxst will unveil and demonstrate is AR smart glasses called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZfWw6tczt4" target="_blank">Revelio</a>. Revelio is a pair of stereoscopic smart glasses and a standalone device that does not require any other accessories like a controller. It is simple to use, the company says, and designed to be lightweight (less than 190 grams), while providing features such as Octa core CPU, 2 G memory, 40 degrees field of view and a 720-pixel display.</p>
