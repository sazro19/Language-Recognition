<p>Almost all, 94 percent, school districts now meet  the Federal Communications Commission's minimum connectivity goal of 100  kilobits per second per student, but 6.5 million students still lack the connectivity  required to take advantage of digital learning, according to the latest <a href="http://stateofthestates.educationsuperhighway.org/" target="_blank">State of the States</a> report from <a href="https://www.educationsuperhighway.org/" target="_blank">EducationSuperHighway</a>.</p>
<p>Altogether, 74,000 schools, 2.6 million teachers  and 39.2 million students now have at least the minimum connectivity to access  digital learning, while 1,587 rural schools still lack adequate infrastructure to  meet the requirements.</p>
<p>"America made a historic promise to our  students in 2013 to connect every school district to high-speed Internet,"  said Evan Marwell, CEO of EducationSuperHighway, in a prepared statement. "We've  made great progress since then; however, our work is far from over. It is  critical that federal and state leaders, schools and service providers continue  the hard work necessary to close the connectivity gap."</p>
