<p><a href="http://www.netop.com/classroom-management-software.htm" target="_blank">Netop</a> has updated its classroom management software, <a href="http://www.netop.com/classroom-management-software/products/netop-vision.htm" target="_blank">Vision</a> and <a href="http://www.netop.com/classroom-management-software/products/netop-vision-pro.htm" target="_blank">Vision Pro</a>, with support for devices running Mac OS X 10.8 or later.</p>
<p>Previous versions of the software supported Android and iOS devices, as well as Chromebooks. In addition to Mountain Lion Support, the new version has improved browser support and includes the Vision Pro Learning Center, an assessment system designed for blended and flipped classrooms.</p>
<p>“At Netop, our goal is to continue to innovate and support the evolving technology in schools," said Kurt Bager, CEO of Netop, in a prepared statement "Now our popular classroom management software provides teachers with expanded support for Mac student computers, which is critical for mixed device environments, or for schools adopting a BYOD strategy. This latest update provides teachers in these new instructional environments with the important features of our classroom management software, which now work with a multitude of student devices including Mac.” </p>
