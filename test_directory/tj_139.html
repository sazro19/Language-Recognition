<p>Google now offers access to details about college when somebody looks up a specific institution in the search engine. The company announced the update to its results screen <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/college-search-google/" target="_blank">in a Google product blog story</a>. According to Product Manager Jacob Schonberg, when a user enters a college name, he or she will receive the usual capsule description from Wikipedia, as well as a menu with quick links to information about admissions, cost, majors, outcomes and other aspects and other stats.</p>
<p>The results tap into data maintained in the <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Education's College Scorecard</a> and <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/" target="_blank">Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS)</a>, a data set covering four-year colleges. The initial rollout focuses on mobile search with a few features on the desktop, said Schonberg.</p>

<p>The results give instant information about the average cost of the school after aid as well as graduation and acceptance rates.</p>
<p>Choosing "students" in the menu gives the latest IPEDS enrollment data and breakdowns by full-time and part-time, race, gender and income, as well as the share of students who are Pell grant recipients. A link to "similar colleges" brings up a page displaying thumbnails of schools in the same geographic location. Choosing "rankings" brings up the institution's position in a number of college ranking lists.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of prospective and recently enrolled people say they've "often felt lost when researching college or financial aid options," wrote Schonberg. "That's why we're bringing a new feature to Search to help you navigate the college search process."</p>
