<p>I can summarize my impression of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/products/surface-pro-3" target="_blank" title="Microsoft Surface Pro 3 product page at microsoft.com">Microsoft's Surface Pro 3</a> tablet PC in a single word: "Finally!" But that wouldn't make for a very informative article. So let me explain in a bit more detail. </p>
<p>In the Surface Pro 3, what  Microsoft has given us, for the first time, is a   tablet  that can  truly replace a traditional notebook. And really that's understatement. For those  involved in creative production — whether student or faculty — the Surface Pro 3 is vastly superior to a traditional laptop.</p>
<p><strong>Form &amp; Functionality</strong><br/>
What makes the Surface Pro 3 unique among tablets is the combination of size, display quality and pressure-sensitive stylus input — coupled with processing power that rivals mid-range traditional laptops.</p>

<p>At 12 inches, the Surface Pro 3's display brings much needed screen real estate to those who do more than just browse Web sites or watch videos. Add to that a fourth-generation Intel Core processor (a 1.9/2.5 GHz Core i5-4300U in the case of the pre-release unit I'm reviewing, but up to a 3.3 GHz Core i7 in shipping models), and this is truly a fully functional computing device. It can do anything any Windows-based computer can do, and it gives you enough screen room, RAM (8 GB in my unit) and storage (256 GB internal, plus SD card slot for internal storage expansion and USB for external storage) to do it  comfortably. </p>
<p>Yes, it can run  office applications, which Chromebooks, iPads and Android devices can do as well — in their own way. But it can also run serious software, from Adobe's Creative Suite  to high-end 3D modeling and animation tools like Autodesk Maya 2015. That differentiates the Surface Pro 3  from all "media tablets" — which is to say Android and iOS tablets — designed primarily for consumption and light use of word processing  or other  productivity tools.</p>

<p>Further, the Surface Pro 3 comes standard with a fully pressure-sensitive stylus, which means that for creative apps like Photoshop, Synthetik Studio Artist, Core Painter and Ambient Design ArtRage, you can not only draw directly on the screen, but you can take advantage of pressure-sensitivity to make the experience much more natural and intuitive.</p>
<p>And this, to me, is what makes the Surface Pro 3 really exciting. To get a good interactive pen display this size — say a Wacom tablet,  of which I'm a fan and which I have owned and used extensively throughout the last two decades — you'd have to spend about $1,000 — about the same as the  Surface Pro 3 itself.</p>
