<p><a href="http://www.powerschool.com/" target="_blank">PowerSchool</a> has selected <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/" target="_blank">Rackspace</a> as the new cloud-service
provider for its PowerSchool student information system (SIS) hosted
service.</p>
<p>The company spent two months evaluating cloud service providers before
selecting Rackspace, a company that has significant experience in planning,
deploying and managing server, storage and network configurations. Factors that
may have influenced PowerSchool's decision included Rackspace's 100 percent
network uptime guarantee (excluding maintenance), enterprise-grade data centers
located around the world, and other components of the company's competitive
service-level agreements.</p>
<p>According to a news release from PowerSchool, the partnership with Rackspace
enables the company to offer its hosted SIS with "ultra-high bandwidth, robust
failover capabilities, data encryption, storage performance and systems
monitoring that meets the needs of large and small school districts in the
United States and internationally."</p>
