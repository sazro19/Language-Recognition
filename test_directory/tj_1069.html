<p>Teacher
Tools is a mobile device management (MDM) application that lets
teachers control student access to mobile device features to help
ensure students remain on-task in the classroom. According to the
company, the Teacher Tools user interface is simplified in an attempt
to make it more accessible for teachers than MDM solutions designed for
IT administrators.
</p>
<p>"Teachers can associate each student with the
assigned device and manage devices for different classes, groups of
students or individuals," according to information from the company.
The Teacher Tools student registration process works with any student
information system and lets teachers organize students by class.
</p>
<p>Key features of Teacher Tools include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>All Eyes Up Front, which lets teachers lock student devices to remove distractions during whole class instruction;</li>
<li>Single
    Application Mode, which lets teachers lock individual or multiple
    student devices into a single application for a specific period of time;</li>
<li>The ability to lock students into a specific Web page or multiple select URLs;</li>
<li>A polling function to solicit responses from individuals or groups of students; and</li>
<li>Clear
    Passcode, which enables teachers to reset student device passcodes
    without looking up serial numbers and access detailed device
    information.</li>
</ul>
