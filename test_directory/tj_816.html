<p>The number of things connected to  the Internet and in use will grow 30 percent from this year to next, for a  total of 4.9 billion, according to a new report from market research firm <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/home.jsp" target="_blank">Gartner</a>, and will hit 25  billion by 2020.</p>
<p>Along with the growth in the  number of devices, Gartner predicts an increase in total spending on the Internet  of Things (IoT) to climb from $69.5 billion next year to $263 billion in 2020.</p>
<p>Defined by Gartner as "the  network of dedicated physical objects (things) that contain embedded technology  to sense or interact with their internal state or external environment,"  the Internet of Things comprises an ecosystem that includes things,  communication, applications and data analysis" that " has become a  powerful force for business transformation" with effects that will be felt  across all industries and areas of society.</p>
<p>Growth in the number of connected  things will be driven by consumer applications, more than quadrupling in the  consumer sector from just less than 2.9 billion in 2015 to more than 13 billion  at the end of the forecast period, but enterprise will account for the majority  of the revenue.</p>

<p>"The digital shift instigated by the nexus  of forces (cloud, mobile, social and information), and boosted by IoT,  threatens many existing businesses. They have no choice but to pursue IoT, like  they've done with the consumerization of IT," said Jim Tully, vice  president and distinguished analyst at Gartner, in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>By 2020, the verticals most affected by the IoT  will be utilities, manufacturing and government, in that order, according to  the company. But many ordinary objects, as well as novel devices, will also  include sensors and computation and communication abilities. "This functionality provides both new  and previously passive objects with a 'digital voice,' and the ability to  create and deliver an information stream reflecting their status and that of  their surrounding environment," according to information released  by the company.</p>
<p>The likelihood that some degree of intelligence  will become standard in the near future "highlights the tight linkages  between information security, information technology security, operational  technology security and physical security like never before," according to  a news release. "Executives now face a decision regarding the future of  security in their enterprise and who governs, manages and operates it." As  a result, "by the end of 2017, over 20 percent of organizations will have  digital security services devoted to protecting business initiatives using  devices and services in IoT."</p>
<p>To accommodate the multiple technologies and  platforms encompassed by the IoT, IT leaders will have to adopt a multifaceted  technology approach to risk and security.</p>
<p>"The number of connected intelligent  devices will continue to grow exponentially, giving 'smart things' the ability  to sense, interpret, communicate and negotiate, and effectively have a digital 'voice',"  said Steve Prentice, vice president and fellow at Gartner, in a prepared  statement. "CIOs must look for opportunities to create new services, usage  scenarios and business models based on this growth."</p>
