<p>Apple is now waiving the fees for its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/" target="_blank">developer program</a> for  accredited educational institutions and other qualifying organizations.</p>
<p>Members of the developer program are able to distribute apps through  the Apple App Store and gain access to tools such as app analytics, beta  testing resources such as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/testflight/" target="_blank">TestFlight</a>,  beta software and advanced app capabilities.</p>
<p>The move comes in response to complaints directed at the company when  it banned apps generated from templates last year, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/03/apple-developer-program-fee-waivers-are-now-available-for-nonprofits-schools-and-government/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>.  That earlier decision was designed to set a quality standard for apps on the  store and to eliminate duplicative apps, but it would also have barred many apps  developed by third parties for schools and other organizations. As a  work-around, Apple is barring those third parties from submitting apps in their  clients' names, but opening the developer program to the client organizations  so they can submit their apps themselves.</p>

<p>In addition to educational institutions, nonprofits and government  entities based in the United States are also eligible to have the $99 fee  waived. Any organization receiving a waiver must release only free apps on the  company's app store. Releasing any paid apps or apps that allow in-app  purchases on the store will invalidate the waiver.</p>
<p>New members must  submit a fee waiver request after they have submitted an enrollment request.  Current developer program members can have future fees waived by submitting a  waiver request any time before their current membership expires.</p>
<p>For more  information, or to apply for a membership or membership fee waiver, visit <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/membership-fee-waiver/" target="_blank">developer.apple.com</a>.</p>
