<p><a href="http://www.aerohive.com/" target="_blank">Aerohive Networks</a> has introduced a version of its network management system that can be run from an on-premises appliance as an alternative to cloud network management. <a href="http://www.aerohive.com/" target="_blank"></a> The company has also added several new features to <a href="http://www.aerohive.com/products/cloud-services-platform/hivemanager-ng" target="_blank">HiveManager Next Generation (NG)</a>.</p>
<p>This network management service provides control of Aerohive network devices — access points, switches and routers — through interactive dashboards, personalized network configurations, real-time monitoring and centralized policy management. The new appliance emulates the cloud-based network management functionality but with an on-premises flavor.</p>
<p>New features include improvements to reporting with the ability to distribute links to reports that can be accessed from any device; better helpdesk troubleshooting, with role-based access control and guided troubleshooting tips; and updated security that provides visibility to rogue access points and clients.</p>

<p>The cloud version of HiveManager NG can be purchased in one-, three- and five-year subscription terms. A one-year plan starts at $95 per access point; pricing varies by access point model.</p>
<p>The on-premises edition requires the purchase of a support contract, a perpetual license fee per access point and support contract per access point.</p>
<p>"By offering an on-premises version of HiveManager NG in addition to the cloud-based version, Aerohive gives customers a choice in deployment models that best fit their needs," said Matthias Machowinski, a research director for consultancy <a href="https://www.ihs.com/index.html" target="_blank">IHS</a>, in a press release. "As an added bonus, Aerohive's flexible licensing model allows customers to change as their needs evolve."</p>
<p>Aerohive networking gear has been in use by Arizona's <a href="http://www.vail.k12.az.us/" target="_blank">Vail School District</a>, <a href="http://boe.rale.k12.wv.us/pages/Raleigh_CSD" target="_blank">Raleigh County School District</a> in North Carolina and <a href="http://www.lvusd.org/" target="_blank">Las Virgenes Unified School District</a> in California, among other school systems.</p>
