<p>“One of the growth factors of the global AR in education market is the demand for student-centric and experiential learning in the education sector,” said Jhansi Mary, a lead analyst at Technavio for ed tech research, in a prepared statement. “The increase in the interest in the development of AR applications and content in the education sector is further catering to the growth of the market. Due to the high price of the HMDs [head mounted displays], the technology is available only to high-end consumers and enterprises. However, vendors are slowly transitioning products to cater to the affordable segment of the market.”</p>
<p>In addition, “the discovery of open source AR applications, which allows teachers and lecturers to create their own basic content, is a huge challenge for the AR vendors catering to the education sector,” according to a news release. “This competition is expected to intensify in the forecast period.”</p>
<p>The report also provides information on the VR in education market, which Technavio expects to grow at a CAGR of more than 55 percent by 2021.</p>
<p>The AR in education report offers an analysis of the market by product type (AR hardware and AR content), by end user (K–12 and higher education) and by geography (Asia Pacific, Europe, North America and the rest of the world).</p>
