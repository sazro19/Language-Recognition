<p>On Tuesday, <a href="http://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a> quietly released <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-products-are-getting-more-affordable-2017-3?r=UK&amp;IR=T" target="_blank">a slew of product updates</a> that included a more affordable iPad device with an enhanced display. </p>
<p>Apple’s newest <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-9.7/" target="_blank">iPad</a> model features a brighter display (2,048 x 1,536 resolution), with more than 3.1 million pixels designed to enhance the quality of photos and videos. As for construction, it will retain its 9.7-inch screen size, discrete glass panel and aluminum unibody enclosure.</p>
<p>With prices starting at $329, it is comparable to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/" target="_blank">iPad Air 2</a>, which the company phased out from its line-up of tablets. It offers a swifter 64-bit A9 processor (compared to the iPad Air 2 which used an A8X chip). However, it still falls behind the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, with their A10 processors, in processing power.</p>
