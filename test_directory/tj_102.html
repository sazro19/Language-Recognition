<p>At the fundamental
level, blockchain is a form of distributed ledger technology that
allows parties to share information with each other through a
controlled system that manages transactions. In the education space,
the technology has the potential to revolutionize how school
districts share and maintain data, but the technology hasn’t
trickled down to the K-12 environment yet.</p>

<p>Universities started
exploring this space over the last few years in academic
credentialing. Transcripts, grades, test scores and digital diplomas
could be stored in a student’s digital wallet, where the student
has control over how the information could be shared. <a href="https://www.blockcerts.org/">Blockcerts,</a>
developed by <a href="https://mitili.mit.edu/mit-integrated-learning-initiative">MIT’s
Integrated Learning Initiative</a> and <a href="https://www.learningmachine.com/">Learning
Machine</a>, is one initiative that is helping
universities and students take ownership of their data when it comes
to digital diplomas.  <a href="https://www.snhu.edu/">Southern
New Hampshire University</a> and <a href="https://www.cnm.edu/">Central
New Mexico Community College</a> have also taken steps to
offer digital diplomas to their graduates.</p>

<p>“Blockcerts is a
global open standard for anchoring any type of document to any
blockchain as secure anchor of trust,” said Natalie Smolenski,
senior vice president of business development at Learning Machine.
“The blockchain basically serves as a kind of global notary for
these academic records, so that even if the issuing institutions
can't be contacted anymore or the software vendor that was used to
issue that record goes out of business or doesn't support that
product anymore, recipients still have their documents and they can
verify them for life.”</p>
<h3>Blockchain in K–12</h3>
<p>While some school
districts have reached out to Learning Machine to understand how
Blockcerts works, there are no current K-12 school systems using the
open standard technology in the United States.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en/?ar=1">
IBM</a>, which is working similarly at the collegiate
level, could not provide any examples of how blockchain is currently
being used by school districts.</p>
<p>However, this is not
keeping technologists and school executives from painting a picture
of where blockchain technology could develop in the K-12 space.  In a
high-level analysis, <a href="https://knowledgeworks.org/">KnowledgeWorks</a>
released a forecast of where the technology could go over the next 10
years.  The 2016 report identifies four possible use cases: a unified
blockchain platform to make administrative tasks more manageable, a
turnkey solution that decentralizes ideas and modules around the
technology for ease of use, an open-source network management tool
for parents to share learning experiences and a blockchain-based
ecosystem management tool to store, analyze and manage
learning-related data.
</p>
<h3>Potential Use
Cases in Action</h3>
<p>Tom Ryan, chief
information and strategy officer for <a href="https://www.sfps.info/">Santa
Fe Public Schools</a>, has been exploring the benefits of
blockchain technology to secure student data and improve the
acquisition process. One of the challenges that school district CIOs
face is how to protect student data and privacy.  School districts
face many of the same challenges when it comes to protecting student,
teacher and staff personally identifiable information, which can
cause major problems when a district or third-party contractor is
hacked.
