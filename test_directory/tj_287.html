<p>Despite gloomier predictions, the mobile phone market grew 4.3 percent worldwide in the first quarter of 2017, with No. 1 Samsung and No. 2 Apple declining slightly in their overall share of the market as Chinese manufacturers surged upward.</p>
<p>According to a new report from market research firm <a href="http://www.idc.com" target="_blank">IDC</a>, Samsung saw no year over year growth from Q1 2016 to Q1 2017. It shipped 79.2 million units in each of those two quarters and lost a point of market share — from a 23.8 percent share of the worldwide market in Q1 2016 to 22.8 percent in Q1 2017.</p>
<p>According to IDC: "Substantial discounts on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge helped move last year's flagships as they make way for the new S8 and S8+. Outside of the high end, the product mix continues to shift toward more affordable models. The J-Series and A-Series drove significant volumes in both emerging and developed markets thanks to flagship-like design at more affordable price points. A refreshed A7, A5, and A3 earlier this quarter, along with a recently updated J-Series, and new flagship S8/S8+ should give Samsung a well-balanced portfolio across all regions in the second quarter. An early positive response to the recently launched S8 and S8+ looks promising as it may have finally put Samsung's Note 7 fiasco to bed."</p>
