<p>Schools looking to streamline their facilities operations can now access best practices from peer institutions through two <a href="https://www.schooldude.com/solutions/overview/new-pro-platforms" target="_blank">Collaborative Operations Management platforms</a> from <a href="http://www.schooldude.com/" target="_blank">SchoolDude</a>.</p>
<p>MaintenanceEssentials Pro (for facilities management) and EventEssentials Pro (for facilities event and community use management) tap into educational data and collective insights from SchoolDude's 6,000 education clients and enable institutions to communicate, collaborate and complete operational work more efficiently, according to the company.</p>
<p>"Our new platform model creates more collaboration opportunities so institutions can take full advantage of operations expertise and big data insights and analysis from schools across the country," said Nick Mirisis, director of marketing and business development for SchoolDude, in a press release. "The new platforms allow educational leaders to use the power of big data to identify and predict operational gaps and emergencies, implement continuous improvement strategies to achieve greater success, and adopt a proactive management model."</p>
