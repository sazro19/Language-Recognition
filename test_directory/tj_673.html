<p><a href="http://www.blackboard.com/" target="_blank">Blackboard</a> and <a href="https://www.pearson.com/" target="_blank">Pearson</a> have revamped the integration of <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/k12/teaching-and-learning/index.aspx" target="_blank">Blackboard's
teaching and learning solutions</a> and <a href="http://www.pearsonschoolsystems.com/products/powerschool/" target="_blank">Pearson
PowerSchool</a> student information system (SIS) in an effort to improve data
management functionality.</p>
<p>According to Blackboard, the integration of Blackboard and PowerSchool now
simplifies the grading and data input process for teachers because they no
longer need to enter assignments and grades into both system separately,
eliminating a redundant step and saving them time.</p>
<p>"Minimizing the time teachers spend on integration, assignment input, grades
and setup will allow them to focus on what's most important: teaching and
learning," said Sam Brooks, personal learning coordinator for <a href="http://pcsstn.com/" target="_blank">Putnam County
Schools</a>, in a prepared statement. "We want to maximize their resources and time
so they can focus on making students successful."</p>
