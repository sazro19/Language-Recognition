<p>Global spending on information technology will reach $3.658 trillion in  2018, according to a new report from <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/home.jsp" target="_blank">Gartner</a>, up 4.3 percent  over this year's projected $3.508 trillion.</p>
<p>Communications services will lead IT spending, accounting for $1.387  trillion this year, a 0.9 percent increase over 2016, to $1.417 trillion in 2018  for growth of 2.2 percent.</p>
<p>The second largest spending category, IT services, is projected to  account for $931 billion in 2017, a year-over-year growth of 4 percent, and $980  billion next year, representing 5.3 percent growth.</p>
<p>Spending on devices will improve for the first time in two years, up 5.3  percent from last year to this for a 2017 total of $664 billion. Devices are  the only category forecast to see a slowdown in growth from 2017 to 2018,  growing at 5 percent to reach $697 billion next year.</p>
<p>"Increased average selling prices for premium phones in mature  markets, partially due to the introduction of the iPhone 8 and 10, along with  an underlying demand for PCs from businesses replacing their machines with  Windows 10 PCs is driving the growth in this segment," according to Gartner.</p>
