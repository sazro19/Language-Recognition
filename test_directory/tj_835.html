<p>Now that the FCC has adopted <em>the E-rate Modernization Order</em>, you may be wondering what it means for your district and what you should do to prepare. While there is no substitute for reading the 176-page order, you can read the FCC’s official summary of the order, which comes in at a much more manageable 10 pages, <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/page/summary-e-rate-modernization-order">here</a>. No matter which reading assignment you choose, there are a few high-level things you can expect as you plan for upgrading broadband and WiFi connections over the next five years.</p>
<p><strong>More Internal Connections </strong></p>
<p>The order sets a target of providing $1 billion annually for internal connections. This category includes basic maintenance, managed WiFi and caching. There are many details here, but the overall intent is to provide some internal connection support for every district once every five years. </p>
<p>The order sets a target of providing $1 billion annually for internal connections. This category includes basic maintenance, managed WiFi, caching and other similar services. As has been the case since the beginning of the E-rate, applicants will continue to pay a percentage of the costs of the E-rate service (called the contribution rate), and the size of that percentage will be based on the poverty level of the population your school serves and whether it is located in a rural or urban area. For broadband connectivity to schools, now termed category one, the minimum contribution rate remains at 10 percent. For internal connections (category two) the minimum contribution rate for schools is 15 percent. The hope is that increasing schools’ minimum contribution will spread available funds more widely and encourage applicants to find the most cost-effective solutions to because they are paying a little more.</p>

<p>A second intent for the way internal connections are handled is to make budgeting for these service more predictable by establishing a specific, per-student amount — $150 pre-discount — over a five-year period. Applications for internal connection funding must be made on a school-by-school basis, which allows districts the flexibility to apply for part of the funds one year and part the next.</p>
<p><strong>Phasing Out of Support for Some Services, Elimination of Others </strong></p>
<p>The discount rate for voice services will be reduced by 20 percentage points every funding year beginning in funding year 2015, which starts July 1, 2015. Paging, e-mail and other similar services will not be eligible for any support at all beginning in the 2015 funding year.</p>
<p><strong>Increased Pricing Transparency </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.usac.org/default.aspx">USAC</a> will be required to make information regarding services and equipment purchased by schools and libraries public. The hope is that this information will help schools and libraries negotiate lower prices when they see the pricing others are getting.</p>
<p><strong>More Consortia and Bulk Purchasing </strong></p>
<p>The order encourages bulk purchasing and purchases made through consortia by prioritizing review of consortia applications and possibly exempting preferred master contracts from filing an FCC Form 470.</p>
<p><strong>A Simplified Application Process </strong></p>
<p>These details won’t be known until USAC figures out all the procedures, but you can count on a streamlined application for multiyear contracts, electronic filing of documents over the next three years and simplified discount rate calculations.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do About It?</strong></p>
<p>Exactly how all this will be handled administratively is yet to be seen. The state E-rate coordinators are scheduled to have a training session with USAC and the FCC late in September, and they will begin to disseminate what they learned in that session some time later in the fall. In the meantime, there is much you can do, some of which is time-sensitive. Here are the top five actions you can take to prepare for implementation of the modernized E-rate.</p>
