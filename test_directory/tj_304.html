<p>The 33-year-old Simi Valley native has used virtual reality to take her students to far-flung places like Antarctica. In her classroom, she wears a microphone connected to <a href="https://www.lightspeed-tek.com" target="_blank">Lightspeed Technologies’</a> <a href="https://www.lightspeed-tek.com/products/topcat/" target="_blank">Topcat</a> and <a href="https://www.lightspeed-tek.com/products/flexcat/" target="_blank">Flexcat</a> audio systems. She also uses many other education technologies to achieve maximum results with a challenging group of special education students. </p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal</em>: Describe how Topcat and Flexcat help you with your students. </strong></p>
<p>Jamie Reese: A lot of research that shows that among kids, (amplification) decreases special ed referrals. It’s beneficial for all to access the curriculum, not just kids hard of hearing. I can also change the tone of my classroom. I no longer have to use my teacher voice, so to speak. The students are able to hear me, and access the system anywhere in the room.</p>
<p>With this population, raising your voice at all can be triggering for them. We can negate that factor. I do not have to modulate my voice a whole lot. For our general education teachers, they’re less fatigued at the end of the day. Projecting your voice takes a lot out of your body.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal</em>: Do you remember a time when you weren’t using technology in the classroom, and have you seen an improvement in teaching and learning since you have?</strong></p>
<p>Reese: I would say yes. Even during my time in special education (eight years), I’ve seen the change. Now we have smart interactive displays and cameras as well. The benefit is, I’m getting to meet kids in their world. They’ve never known a world without the internet or without <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/" target="_blank">iPads</a>. Some of the ways we used to teach — it doesn’t make sense to them. My room has shifted from being teacher-centered to student-centered. They have much more ownership over their learning.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal</em>: Some old-school teachers might argue that incorporating technology into one’s teaching requires more work and sucks up more personal time. </strong></p>
<p>Reese: It does take a lot of time. It’s definitely a shift — it’s going to be a lot of work. But you have to change your habits. So really, it’s actually knowing what the standards are and making them really accessible. Curriculum doesn’t drive the learning. You really need to know what the standards are, and make sure you’re referring to them. But these days we’re seeing a lot more student-centered learning.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal</em>: You told me you’ve gone 1-to-1 with computer devices in your classroom. Describe that, and which do you prefer, the Chromebook or the iPad?</strong></p>
