<p>The “App Development with Swift” curriculum is an extension of Apple’s K–12 curriculum, <a href="https://www.apple.com/education/everyone-can-code/" target="_blank">Everyone Can Code</a>, which has been downloaded more 430,000 times and will be used at more than a thousand schools this fall, the statement said. The latter curriculum also teaches students to use Swift and <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/09/09/apple-launches-everyone-can-code-initiative-and-apple-teacher-program.aspx" target="_blank">fulfills the company’s pledge to the White House-led ConnectED initiative </a>to advance computer science education. </p>
<p>The company’s programming language has been used to create apps like Airbnb, KAYAK, TripAdvisor, Venmo and Yelp, according to the statement. A <a href="https://www.upwork.com/press/2017/01/26/upwork-reveals-fastest-growing-skills-q4-natural-language-processing-tech-skills-top-list/" target="_blank">recent study by global freelancing platform Upwork</a> identified Swift as the second fasting-growing skill in the tech industry, Apple says the new curriculum is designed for students who want to enter the rapidly growing app economy and seek to “gain critical job skills in software development and information technology.” </p>
<p>The curriculum is available for free through iBooks. </p>
