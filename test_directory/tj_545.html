<p><a href="https://www.schoology.com/" target="_blank">Schoology</a> has integrated its learning management system (LMS)  with
the <a href="https://www.infinitecampus.com" target="_blank">Infinite Campus</a> student
information system (SIS). The hope is that the integration will
streamline data
entry and save time for educators. As an example, teachers now will not
need to
manually enter final grades in both systems or make updates in both
throughout
the school year.</p>
<p>Schoology will support the IMS OneRoster standard,
which is a subset of the
broader Learning Information Services standard. By conforming to the
standard,
SIS vendors can create the kinds of integrations that Schoology has
announced.
As a consequence, a turn-key integration between an SIS and an LMS is
possible.</p>
<p>The integration will help schools synchronize
student grades and enrollment
information across both systems. That should improve the accuracy of
student
data by eliminating the potential for human data-entry errors and
assure that
both systems contain the most up-to-date information.</p>

<p>"By integrating the two platforms, our customers
are gaining the ability to
streamline much of their work, saving them valuable time by cutting
back on
duplicate administrative work," said Schoology CEO Jeremy Friedman.
"With this
time saved, teachers can put their efforts back into the classroom
working with
their students where it matters most."</p>
<p>Said Eduardo Carneiro, applications engineering
manager for the <a href="https://www.pausd.org" target="_blank">Palo Alto Unified School District</a>, "This integration will
eliminate the need to
enter final grades in both the systems or make updates in both systems
throughout the year, even when teachers switch sections or new students
join a
class."</p>
<p>This is just the most recent of a <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/02/03/schoology-integrates-skyward-respondus.aspx" target="_blank">number of integrations </a>the
company has
made to allow other companies" systems to work with Schoology's system.</p>
