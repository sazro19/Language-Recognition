<p><a href="http://laconiaschools.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Laconia School District</a> in New Hampshire plans to implement high-speed, fiber-based Internet
service to support its three elementary schools, middle school, high
school and regional technical center. </p>
<p>Demand for Internet
access has been ramping up in the district as teachers and students
make increasing use of online technologies and applications, and
Jeffrey Twombly, network manager for the district, wanted to find a
local vendor who could provide them with future-proofed service at a
competitive price. "We serve approximately 2,000 students and part of
ensuring their educational success is having reliable, high speed
Internet from a provider upon whom we can rely and trust," he said in a
news release.</p>
<p>Twombly and his team evaluated numerous vendors before selecting <a href="https://www.firstlight.net/" target="_blank">FirstLight Fiber</a>,
a provider of fiber optic data, Internet, data center and voice
services based in Albany, NY. "FirstLight stood out among all of the
potential vendors we reviewed for enabling the bandwidth expansions
that we will inevitably need down the road, while also offering the
high quality, localized customer service and support we need today," he
said.</p>

<p>The upgraded Internet service will enable students,
teachers and staff to access streaming video, online courses, webinars
and other online services well into the future, according to a news
release from FirstLight. The company will also provide the most of
Laconia School District's facilities with fiber-based voice service.</p>
