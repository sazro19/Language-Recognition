<p><a href="http://www.calhoun.k12.al.us/" target="_blank">Calhoun County Schools</a> in
Alabama has implemented a district-wide high speed wireless network to support
its bring-your-own-device (BYOD) initiative.</p>
<p>Through the district's "Power Up BYOD Learning Initiative," students,
faculty and staff can bring their personal mobile devices to school, and
students are allowed to use their devices to access digital learning resources
under the direction of their classroom teacher. To support this initiative and
the resulting influx of mobile devices, as well as the addition of Apple TVs to
classrooms, the district needed to upgrade its wireless network
infrastructure.</p>
<p>The district selected <a href="http://www.adtran.com/web/page/portal/Adtran/wp_procloud" target="_blank">ProCloud</a>
managed service from Adtran. According to information on the company's site,
the service includes centralized configuration and firmware management, 24/7
monitoring and alerts and technical support. By outsourcing management of the
Wi-Fi network, the district hopes to free up IT staff for other projects.</p>

<p>The district is using the service to provide wireless access to more than
9,300 students, teachers and administrators. The service will support all 16
schools in the district, as well as a technical career center, athletic fields
and four administrative offices through a single network.</p>
<p>"Students are really excited about the high-speed connectivity and
educational tech tools they can now leverage as a result of the new network,"
said Jenel Travis, IT director for Calhoun County Schools, in a prepared
statement.</p>
<p>Some of those educational tools include the Pearson SuccessMaker digital
learning curriculum, Apex Learning digital curriculum, and Google Apps,
according to information on the district's site.</p>
