<p>Even as  the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/" target="_blank">Federal  Communications Commission</a> has begun <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2017/02/07/fcc-blocks-9-companies-from-providing-low-income-internet-access.aspx" target="_blank">rolling back efforts to keep the  Internet affordable</a>,  a school district in Southern California this week is enjoying the largesse of  telecommunications company <a href="https://www.sprint.com/" target="_blank">Sprint</a>. As part of its <a href="http://goodworks.sprint.com/1millionproject/" target="_blank">1Million Project</a>, intended to outfit a million low-income students  with reliable connectivity in their homes, the company has begun issuing free  mobile hotspot devices and wireless connectivity. This week 300 students lined  up to receive their hotspot devices; eventually that count will reach 500.</p>
<p>The  intention of the giveaway is to address the "homework gap" that  surfaces as teachers assign more work for students to do at home, including  those who may not have ready access to computing gear or internet. Eventually,  the program will reach a million students with the home connectivity they need  to do their school assignments.</p>

<p>"Our  students will be able to pair devices with their Sprint mobile hotspots,  helping to close the digital homework gap," said district Superintendent, Richard  Martinez, in a prepared statement. "We are grateful to companies like Sprint  that are using the 1Million Project to deliver equity for 500 students,  allowing them to thrive in their studies outside of the school  environment."</p>
<p>Pomona is  one of 11 pilot markets to test the program, which is expected to run through  the end of this school year. The program itself is scheduled to run over five  years.</p>
<p>The  project is inviting local high schools and school districts that can identify,  enroll and support a minimum of 300 and a maximum of 5,000 high school students  over each year of the length of the project who do not have high-speed internet  access at home.</p>
<p>Schools  and school districts can apply to the program <a href="http://goodworks.sprint.com/1millionproject/#enrollment" target="_blank">on the Sprint website here</a> through March 31, 2017. Qualified  students will receive service for four years. They'll have 3 GB of high-speed  LTE data per month; after that they can continue accessing the internet at 256  kilobits per second or purchase a data refill card.</p>
