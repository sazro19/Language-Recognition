<p>The House of Representatives voted Tuesday to block online privacy regulations issued during the final months of the Obama administration, a first step toward allowing internet providers such as <a href="http://corporate.comcast.com" target="_blank">Comcast</a>, <a href="https://www.att.com">AT&amp;T</a> and <a href="http://www.verizon.com" target="_blank">Verizon</a> to sell the browsing habits of their customers, <a href="https://www.apnews.com/3c27f9a690e04177bbcf7607928062d9/House-votes-to-block-Obama-era-online-privacy-rule" target="_blank">according to the Associated Press</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fcc.gov" target="_blank">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) rule was designed to give consumers greater control over how internet service providers share information. But critics said the rule would have added costs, stifled innovation and picked winners and losers among internet companies.</p>

<p>The House voted 215-205 to reject the rule, and sent the legislation to President Donald Trump for his signature. The vote is part of an extensive effort that Republicans have undertaken to void an array of regulations issued during the final months of Democratic President Barack Obama's tenure. But the vote was closer this time than previous rescind efforts, with 15 Republicans siding with Democrats in the effort to keep the rule in place.</p>
<p>Minority Leader <a href="https://pelosi.house.gov" target="_blank">Nancy Pelosi</a> (D-CA), said the Republican-led effort was about putting profits over the privacy concerns of Americans.</p>
<p>"Overwhelmingly, the American people do not agree with Republicans that this information should be sold, and it certainly should not be sold without your permission," Pelosi said to the Associated Press. "Our broadband providers know deeply personal information about us and our families."</p>
<p>Internet companies like <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> don't have to ask users' permission before tracking what sites they visit. Republicans and industry groups have blasted that discrepancy, saying it was unfair and confusing for consumers.</p>
<p>But proponents of the privacy measure argued that the company that sells you your internet connection can see even more about consumers, such as every website they visit and whom they exchange emails with.</p>
<p>Undoing the FCC regulation leaves people's online information in a murky area. Experts say federal law still requires broadband providers to protect customer information — but it doesn't spell out how or what companies must do. That's what the FCC rule aimed to do.</p>
<p>The Trump-appointed chairman of the FCC, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/ajit-pai" target="_blank">Ajit Pai</a>, is a critic of the broadband privacy rules and has said he wants to roll them back. He and other Republicans want a different federal agency, the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov" target="_blank">Federal Trade Commission</a>, to police privacy for both broadband companies like AT&amp;T and internet companies like Google. GOP lawmakers said they cared about consumer privacy every bit as much as Democrats did.</p>
<p>"What America needs is one standard across the internet ecosystem and the Federal Trade Commission is the best place for that standard," said <a href="https://walden.house.gov" target="_blank">Rep. Greg Walden</a> (R-OR).</p>
<p>Republican Leader <a href="http://kevinmccarthy.house.gov" target="_blank">Kevin McCarthy</a> of California said the FTC has acted as America's online privacy regulator since the dawn of the internet. He called the rule an effort to strip the agency of that role.</p>
<p>"The internet has become the amazing tool that it is because it is largely left untouched by regulation — and that shouldn't stop now," McCarthy said.</p>
