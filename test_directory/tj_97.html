<p>Imagine
if students left high school with a secure, permanent digital record
of all their accomplishments — their academic achievement,
extra-curricular experiences, community service and more — that
followed them throughout college and into the workplace. Every new
degree, certification, digital badge or other honor they earned
throughout their lives would be added to this record like links in a
chain, and these credentials would be tamper-proof to give employers
some assurance that students actually earned them.</p>
<p>This
technology exists now, and it’s being used by a small but growing
number of colleges and universities around the world to empower
students by giving them ownership of their official record. K-12
education is likely to follow soon.</p>
<p>The
technology is called “blockchain,” and it’s the same technology
used by Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies to keep a secure and
reliable record of financial transactions. In the academic world,
blockchain is being used to link students’ educational records
together — and it’s poised to revolutionize the credentialing
process.</p>

<p>“The
ability to recognize all kinds of learning experiences throughout a
student’s education, and have that record follow the student, is
very exciting,” says Samantha Adams Becker, a futurist in residence
at Penn State University and a consultant to the <a href="https://cosn.org/">Consortium
for School Networking</a>
(CoSN). “Blockchain has the potential to seamlessly connect K-12
with higher education, careers and professional learning.”</p>
<h3>Driving
K-12 Innovation</h3>
<p>Blockchain
is one of many technologies that Becker and other edtech experts are
watching closely as part of a new CoSN initiative to help K-12
superintendents and chief technology officers lead innovation in
their schools.</p>
<p>Called
“<a href="https://cosn.org/k12innovation">Driving
K-12 Innovation</a>,”
the project will produce a series of three reports each year about
emerging issues that could affect teaching and learning.
</p>
<p>The
first report, released
in January 2019, focused
on the “Hurdles” holding back K-12 innovation. The second report,
released just last week,
focused
on “Accelerators” driving changes in K-12 education. The third
report, expected in June 2019, will highlight five “Tech Enablers,”
or emerging technologies that can help schools overcome the chosen
hurdles and put the accelerators into practice. A toolkit for
K-12 leaders will tie these reports together with practical guidance
for integrating the technologies in question.</p>
<p>The
initiative is led by Becker, who managed the Horizon Report series
for the now-defunct New Media Consortium (NMC). The yearly Horizon
Reports explored the top technology trends affecting education. NMC
issued two Horizon Reports each year: a higher-education version and
a K-12 version that was produced in conjunction with CoSN. The
higher-education technology group EDUCAUSE now produces the higher-ed
version, and the “Driving K-12 Innovation” series will build on
the work that began with the K-12 version.</p>
<p>CoSN
Chief Executive Officer Keith Krueger describes the new initiative as
“more holistic” in nature than the Horizon Report series. Instead
of creating a document that was downloaded only once a year, “we
are trying to create a year-round conversation about technology’s
role in driving K-12 innovation,” he says.
</p>
<p>As
with the Horizon Report series, an <a href="https://cosn.org/driving-k-12-innovation-advisory-board">advisory
board</a>
consisting of nearly 100 edtech experts will convene in an online
community to discuss the challenges, opportunities, and emerging
technologies affecting K-12 education. The advisory board will then
choose the hurdles, accelerators, and tech enablers to be featured in
the reports.</p>
