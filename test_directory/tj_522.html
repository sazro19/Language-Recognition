<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.truenorthlogic.com" target="_blank">Truenorthlogic</a> has launched a new mobile attendance app that’s designed to save K-12 teachers in professional development time and paperwork. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The<a href="http://www.truenorthlogic.com/products/pd/mobile/" target="_blank"> Truenorthlogic Mobile App</a> allows instructors to display a QR code for their course on a computer screen or device, or print the code on table tents and nametags. Course participants can then use their smartphone or tablet cameras to scan the code and register their attendance upon arrival. They can also display a participant QR code for the instructor to scan. The app automatically syncs each attendance record with the school district’s<a href="http://www.truenorthlogic.com/products/pd/" target="_blank"> Truenorthlogic PD</a> course catalog. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“The new app makes it easier than ever to track attendance at professional learning events,” said Jeanette Haren, chief product officer for Truenorthlogic, in a prepared statement. “Eliminating the need for sign-in sheets saves valuable time for instructors and participants, so they can focus their attention on the course content.” </p>

<p dir="ltr">The app also gives users the ability to view course information, such as the date, time, instructor and location. Users can search for upcoming courses or get directions via<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@33.6506961,-117.7555593,15z" target="_blank"> Google Maps</a>. In addition, teachers can use the app to review section rosters and simplify attendance for courses that meet more than once a day. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The Truenorthlogic Mobile Attendance App is included with a school district’s license to Truenorthlogic PD, which ranges in price from $5-$9 per user for the first year, a spokeswoman said. Once a district has Truenorthlogic PD, the app is available for free download in<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.truenorthlogic.mobile" target="_blank"> Google Play</a> for Android and in the Apple App store for iOS. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Truenorthlogic is a Sandy, UT-based company that provides professional growth software for educators and K-12 agencies. </p>
