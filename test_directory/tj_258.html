<p>It is inevitable that our children will seek to create social media accounts, interact with people online, share information, and post day to day activities and thoughts for the world to see. The number of apps, sites and games presented to them are too numerous to even list. For parents, understanding the ins and outs of social media and related sites and apps can be a daunting and never-ending task. This article presents some ideas and suggestions to work towards being a more informed digital parent. </p>
<p><strong>Good Digital Parenting </strong> </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fosi.org" target="_blank">Family Online Safety Institute</a> recommends that parents engage in “7 Steps to Good Digital Parenting” to keep abreast of all that is digital in our children’s lives. </p>
<p>1. <strong>Talk with your children</strong>. Talk to your children about your concerns regarding social media. Start discussing technology, the potential dangers, and what it can be used for at an early age. Remember to be open and honest about the issue. Most elementary schools begin educating children in the primary grades about proper and ethical technology use, so extending the conversation to home can be a great team effort!</p>

<p>2. <strong>Educate yourself</strong>. Technology moves at the speed of light. New things are developed every day that may or may not be appropriate for your child’s age group. If you do not have firsthand knowledge of an app or website, search for information about it. If an app has been deemed inappropriate or misleading in its function, then parents or advocacy groups are posting online about it! Go ahead and download or install the app on your own device and see for yourself. Sometimes the best approach is to just try it yourself and then you be the judge. </p>
<p>3. <strong>Use parental controls</strong>. Check the safety controls on all of the Android and Apple devices that your family uses. On the iPhone, you can tap SETTINGS &gt; GENERAL&gt; RESTRICTIONS and you can create a password that allows you enable/disable apps and phone functions. On Android devices, you can turn on Google Play Parental Controls by going into the Google Play Store settings. From there, you can create a parent pin that allows you to filter to age appropriate content and apps. In addition to these two stock features, parents can always purchase, download and install parental monitoring software such as <a href="https://www.netnanny.com" target="_blank">NetNanny</a>, <a href="http://www.phonesheriff.com" target="_blank">PhoneSherriff</a>, <a href="https://us.norton.com/norton-family-premier" target="_blank">Norton Family Premier</a> and <a href="https://www.qustodio.com/en/" target="_blank">Qustodio</a>. A simple online search for “parental device control” will produce a number of options with ranges of pricing. </p>
<p>4. <strong>Friend and follow your children on social media</strong>. Whether it’s <a href="https://musical.ly/" target="_blank">musical.ly</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com" target="_blank">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, chances are that your children use some form of social media. If you have not already, then create an account and get on their friends list. If you are on his or her friends list, then you will see everything that your son or daughter posts, shares, receives and comments on. You will get a good idea of who his or her friends are and what he or she is sharing. Remember to respect their online space and refrain from commenting on posts. Your goal is to review the content and to encourage your children to keep a good digital reputation.</p>
