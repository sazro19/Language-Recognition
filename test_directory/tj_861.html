<p>Shipments of Apple's iPad have fallen off 13 percent so far this year. Meanwhile, according to a <a href="https://www.abiresearch.com/market-research/service/media-tablets-netbooks-ereaders/" target="_blank">new report</a>, Samsung's tablet shipments have increased 26 percent in the first half of 2014.</p>
<p>According to market research firm <a href="https://www.abiresearch.com/" target="_blank">ABI Research</a>, Apple and Samsung continued to account for roughly 70 percent of all tablet shipments in the first half of 2014. However, there is a new contender on the block.</p>
<p>"The roller coaster ride from the leading two tablet vendors has market watchers looking to other vendors to create sustainable growth," said ABI Senior Practice Director Jeff Orr, in a statement released to coincide with the report. "All eyes are on Lenovo as it is one of few to demonstrate consistent growth over the past year."</p>
<p>Additionally, ABI noted that Intel has continued to "show progress toward its goal of 40 million devices powered by its processors in 2014. While many tablets will come out in non-branded models, 2014 looks to be the tipping point for Intel's mobility processor strategy. The company has also set up market-specific relationships that should propel it forward during 2015."</p>

<p> "Forty million units is only a minor dent in ARM's domination of tablets, though Intel is quickly becoming a formidable applications processor architecture competitor,"  Orr said.</p>
<p>Overall, according to ABI, tablet growth for 2014 looks like it will slow to a "disappointing" 2.5 percent and fail to hit the 200 million unit milestone.</p>
