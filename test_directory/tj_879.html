<p>A new project-based learning platform created by ed tech entrepreneur and speaker Adam Bellow is now out for iPad. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/welearnedit/id906780940?mt=8" target="_blank">WeLearnedIt</a> lets teachers assign projects to students and assess them using a number of multimedia features. </p>
<p><img alt="welearned it pbl ipad app" height="250" src="http://1105cms01.com/sitecore/shell/Controls/Rich%20Text%20Editor/%7E/media/A4CE1D6960474680B0E893A03A52A319.ashx" style="float: right;" width="344"/>Teachers can use the app to set up classes with all of their students, and then create individual projects for students to complete, tapping into a multimedia library culled from Bellow’s other site, <a href="https://educlipper.net" target="_blank">eduClipper</a>, to provide any necessary context. Students then complete their projects by crafting or uploading text, images, videos, and annotations, and upload them for assessment, which can take the form of audio, video, or badges. </p>
<p>Parents can also sign up for accounts and view their students’ assignments and any feedback received from instructors. Both administrators and teachers have access to reporting features that help track student growth over time. These reports can be shared with parents as well. Students’ work can also be compiled into learning portfolios, grouped by class or area of interest. </p>

<p>"Educators and students need and deserve tools that support teaching and learning and respect the user," Bellow said in a statement. "Our mission is to make project based learning more accessible and to help provide a fuller and more transparent educational experience."</p>
<p>The platform is an iPad exclusive for now, but Bellow indicated that it would migrate to the web and other operating systems in time. "We chose to release an iPad app first because we know many schools that have gone 1:1 are looking for a solution to incorporate project based learning. We want all teachers and students to have the ability to use our platform and will therefore be launching on other devices shortly."</p>
