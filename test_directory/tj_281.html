<p>Cyberattacks appear to be <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/government-cyber-attacks-increase-2015-439206" target="_blank">on the rise</a>; however, young professionals equipped with computer science (CS) skills to combat those threats are not growing at the same pace as the need.</p>
<p>That’s the assessment from various recent sources and reports, from <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/24/uk-fraud-hits-record-high-after-increase-in-cyber-attacks.html" target="_blank">news sites</a> to <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/3094363/security/cyber-attacks-are-on-the-rise.html" target="_blank">companies that track cybersecurity</a>. One report released last month by the <a href="https://www.ecs.org" target="_blank">Education Commission of the States</a>, titled “<a href="https://www.ecs.org/ec-content/uploads/MassCAN-Full-Report-v10.pdf" target="_blank">State of the States Landscape Report: State-Level Policies Supporting Equitable K–12 Computer Science Education</a>,” stated, “There are simply not enough adequately trained people to fill the current need for information security analysts, hardware engineers, software developers, computer programmers, data scientists and other STEM professionals. States must both inspire and prepare a far greater number of students to pursue CS education and related careers.”</p>

<p>That’s where organizations like <a href="https://www.pltw.org" target="_blank">Project Lead the Way</a> (PLTW) come in. The Indianapolis-based nonprofit develops STEM curricula, including CS classes, for American K–12 schools, teachers and students.</p>

<p>David Greer</p>
</div>
<p>David Greer is the newly hired senior vice president and chief program officer for Project Lead the Way. He’s responsible for three major areas: content and curriculum development, professional development and training, and assessments and evaluations for students. </p>
<p>Before PLTW, he worked as executive director for the <a href="https://engineering.utulsa.edu/academics/centers-institutes/isec/" target="_blank">Institute for Information Security</a> at the <a href="https://utulsa.edu" target="_blank">University of Tulsa</a> in Oklahoma. So Greer knows a little something about cyberattacks and the defense mechanisms and skills needed to thwart those nefarious efforts. </p>
<p><em>THE Journal</em> caught up with Greer to inquire about his responsibilities at PLTW, as well as his assessment of cyberattacks and how prepared the American workforce is to deal with them. </p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> Why do you think computer science education so critical?</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Greer:</strong> There are a lot of statistics out there, but if you look at everything we do nowadays, everything we work with is interoperable and interconnected. We need computer science expertise in the workforce. If you look at computer and math related fields by 2022, we’re not even on track to produce a fraction of that workforce. </p>
<p>At every level, from K–12 through higher education, computer science really creates thinkers, a deep problem-solving mindset and perseverance, which leads to a successful citizen and employee. Computer science creates these transportable skills that can be transportable to college and their careers.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> Can you comment on the growing need for cybersecurity? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Greer:</strong> Cybersecurity is a critical component to everybody’s life. Everything is interconnected now, from business to school to government. We need a cyber savvy workforce. Just as far as our needs as a country are concerned — electric, oil and gas pipelines are all part of a computerized grid. We need to have these on secure platforms. Right now, we really don’t have a workforce that can meet that demand. </p>
