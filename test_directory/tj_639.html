<p><a href="http://stafford.schoolfusion.us/" target="_blank">Stafford County Public Schools</a> (SCPS) has adopted a new enterprise resource
planning (ERP) system in an effort to improve the speed and accuracy of processing transactions.</p>
<p>SCPS, with more than 27,000 students at 30 schools, chose to adopt
<a href="http://www.tylertech.com/solutions-products/munis-product-suite" target="_blank">Munis</a>, from <a href="http://www.tylertech.com/" target="_blank">Tyler Technologies</a>, to replace separate financial, HR, payroll and benefits systems.</p>
<p>"We determined after conducting due diligence that Munis is a robust and affordable system that is fully automated and integrated, which
addresses the functional needs and requirements we were looking for in a new system," said SCPS Assistant Superintendent for Financial Services
Lance Wolff, in a prepared statement. "With Munis, we'll be able to provide our users with more timely information, improved reporting
capabilities, and the ability to eliminate redundant and unnecessary manual processes."</p>
