<p>As new Wi-Fi standard  802.11ac begins to make inroads into schools, Fluke Networks is introducing updated editions  of its tools for designing and troubleshooting wireless networks. The company is  adding 802.11ac functionality to <a href="http://www.flukenetworks.com/products/airmagnet-survey" target="_blank">AirMagnet Survey PRO</a> and <a href="http://www.flukenetworks.com/enterprise-network/wireless-network/AirMagnet-WiFi-Analyzer" target="_blank">AirMagnet WiFi Analyzer PRO</a>.</p>
<p>Wireless networking gear built to the  new standard promises near-gigabit performance, high transmission rates, greater  range and higher density, features that are finding favor in school district environments  where large numbers of users congregate and expect to use their mobile devices.</p>
<p>According to telecommunications research  firm <a href="http://www.infonetics.com/" target="_blank">Infonetics</a>, access points built to the 11ac specification  are expected to account for about three quarters of all AP shipments by 2017. Right  now shipment of 11ac gear is having a "much faster ramp" than 11n, due,  the company said, "to the relatively small price premium of 11ac products."  Infonetics projects that two-thirds of users who are currently using a/b/g networking  gear will skip 802.11n altogether and go directly to 11ac.</p>

<p>And none too soon for users. <a href="https://www.abiresearch.com/" target="_blank">ABI Research</a> estimated that nearly three-quarters of mobile handset shipments with  Wi-Fi will be based on 11ac by 2015.</p>
<p>However, warned <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/home.jsp" target="_blank">Gartner</a>, in a research report, although "more  bandwidth is good, and 802.11ac can better support high transaction dense environments"  the new standard "does not solve the underlying problem of poorly or inadequately  implemented WLANs."</p>
<p>One temptation when a network is  being upgraded to 11ac is to put APs into the same locations where the last set  of APs was placed. That's a problem, said Dilip Advani, Fluke's director of product  marketing and management. "The original network was designed for 2.4  gigahertz. With 11ac being a 5 gigahertz technology, some of the design and  deployment decisions [network people] made earlier may not work here... They  need to define their migration strategy before rolling out any access points  physically." He added that network designers may find they don't need to  go to 11ac. "Maybe 11n is good enough."</p>
<p>Advani added that the other  "temptation" people face, especially when a user complains about  wireless performance, is to "buy another AP and throw it [up]. It's easy  and fast. But when you install it, it may cause even more problems in regards  to interference and may even reduce the performance."</p>
<p>That's where Fluke's new products  come in. AirMagnet Survey PRO is an application for doing site surveys and determining  the number, location and configuration of the specific APs a school has chosen  for its wireless network. The program can produce a "weather map" of  radio frequency and user performance metrics to guide the network deployment.  The new version of Survey PRO allows the network engineer to specify what 11ac  APs will be used.</p>
<p>AirMagnet WiFi Analyzer PRO  provides users a toolkit for detecting and troubleshooting Wi-Fi performance  problems. The new version of the software adds the capability of working with  11ac network gear.<br/>

<p>The company indicated it expects AirMagnet  Survey PRO to be available this month. The PRO edition includes <a href="http://www.flukenetworks.com/enterprise-network/wireless-network/AirMagnet-Planner" target="_blank">AirMagnet Planner</a>, software for designing the  network pre-deployment and generating a bill of materials. Survey Pro is listed  for $4,235.</p>
<p>Analyzer PRO will be available in the  last quarter of 2014. That will have a list price of $4,115.</p>
<p>"Adding more 802.11ac capabilities  to our AirMagnet products will help wireless engineers and technicians deploy Gigabit  Wi-Fi networks right the first time, without costly redesigns or network overhauls,"  said Advani. "Using Fluke Networks, they will get the Wi-Fi performance they're  paying for and can solve problems accurately and faster than ever before."</p>
<p>Fluke's network tools have been  used in Utah's <a href="http://jordandistrict.org/" target="_blank">Jordan School District</a>, <a href="http://www.carrolltoncityschools.net/" target="_blank">Carrollton City Schools</a> in Georgia and <a href="http://www.springlakeparkschools.org/" target="_blank">Spring Lake Park Schools</a> in Minnesota.</p>
