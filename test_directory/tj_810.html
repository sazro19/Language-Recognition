<br/><p>Participants almost universally identified four key factors affecting the recent growth of the digital testing and assessment market segment:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Common Core State Standards are changing curricula.</li>
<li>The rollout of Common Core assessments is galvanizing activity.</li>
<li>There is widespread demand for more and better formative assessments.</li>
<li>Testing and assessment is leading the transition from print to digital.</li>
</ol>
<p>Karen Billings, vice president of the SIIA Education Division (pictured), commented, “We view the growth of the preK-12 testing and assessment market segment over the last several years as even more remarkable, given that it has occurred in difficult economic times during an overall preK-12 budget and spending decline.” </p>
