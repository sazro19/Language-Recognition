<p><a href="http://www.aisd.net/" target="_blank">Arlington Independent School District</a> in
Texas has implemented a data warehouse solution to integrate information from
the district's multiple information systems.</p>
<p>One of the goals of the district's 2012-2015 strategic plan, "<a href="http://www.aisd.net/information/Strategic_Plan.aspx" target="_blank">Achieve
Today. Excel Tomorrow</a>," is for 100 percent of students to graduate on time.
According to the district's
<a href="http://www.aisd.net/pdf/Strategic_Plan/Yr1report-metrics.pdf" target="_blank">year one
report</a> in September 2013, only 51 percent of Arlington ISD high school
students in 2012-13 were on track to graduate within four years of entering
ninth grade. To achieve this ambitious increase in graduation rates, the
district decided it needed a comprehensive way to store and report the data
related to student objectives, which had previously been isolated in multiple
information systems. </p>
<p>Arlington ISD selected the
<a href="http://www.escholar.com/products-services/complete-data-warehouse-for-pk-12/" target="_blank">
eScholar Complete Data Warehouse</a>, which is built on the same foundation as
the <a href="http://www.tea.state.tx.us/tsds2/" target="_blank">Texas Student Data System</a>
(TSDS), a statewide data collection, management and reporting system. By using
eScholar, Arlington ISD will be able to combine the data already collected for
the state with its own data to glean "more actionable information," according to
the company. </p>

<p>The district plans to implement eScholar in a phased approach, beginning with
its dashboards this fall. The dashboards will enable district administrators to
view "district report card items that align with their strategic plan, such as
the percentage of students on track to graduate," according to the company. The
system will provide the district with a "synthesized view" of each school, so
they can monitor improvement in performance metrics such as the
<a href="http://www.tea.state.tx.us/student.assessment/staar/" target="_blank">State of Texas
Assessments of Academic Readiness</a> (STAAR). The district will also be able to
highlight actionable information by customizing status indicators and
annotations.</p>
<p>Arlington Independent School District in Arlington, TX serves 64,000 students
in its 10 high schools, 13 junior high schools and 52 elementary schools.</p>
