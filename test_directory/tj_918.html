<p>The  physical location of data will become "increasingly irrelevant" over  the next several years and will be replaced by other notions of location at most  organizations by 2020, according to a new report, "<a href="http://www.gartner.com/doc/2724017" target="_blank">The  Snowden Effect: Data Location Matters</a>," by market research firm <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/home.jsp" target="_blank">Gartner</a>.</p>
<p>Discussions  of data residency and sovereignty have risen sharply in the last year, slowing  down technology innovation, according to Carsten Casper, research vice president  at Gartner. "Originally  triggered by the dominance of U.S. providers on the Internet and the Patriot  Act, the perceived conflict was then fueled by revelations of unexpected  surveillance by the National Security Agency (NSA) made public by Edward  Snowden," according to a news release.</p>
<p>"IT leaders find themselves entangled in  data residency discussions on different levels and with various stakeholders  such as legal advisors, customers, regulatory authorities, employee  representatives, business management, and the public," Casper said, in a  prepared satement. "Business leaders must make  the decision and accept the residual risk, balancing different types of risk:  ongoing legal uncertainty, fines or public outrage, employee dissatisfaction or  losing market share due to a lack of innovation, or overspending on redundant or  outdated IT."</p>

<p>The Gartner report defines four types of data location:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical location, which is traditionally  equated with physical control and security of data. "Although  everybody knows that locally stored data can be accessed remotely,"  according to a news release, "the desire for physical control still  exists, especially among regulatory bodies. Gartner advises organizations not  to dismiss concerns about physical location, and instead balance the discussion  with other types of risk."</li>
<li>Legal  location is determined by the entity controlling the data, though it may be  processed by an entity in another physical location. Many IT professionals are  not familiar with the idea of legal location, according to Gartner. "Statements like 'it's illegal to  store such data outside the country' are often interpretations of legal  language that is far less clear," said Casper, in a prepared statement. "Each  organization must decide whether they accept those interpretations."</li>
<li>Politcal  location of data includes "Considerations  such as law enforcement access requests, use of inexpensive labor in other  countries that puts local jobs at risk or questions of international political  balance," which "are more important for public sector entities,  nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), companies that serve millions of  consumers or those whose reputation is already tainted," according to the  company.</li>
<li>Logical location is determined by access to  data and who has it. "For example," according to Gartner, "a  German company signs a contract with the Irish subsidiary of a U.S. cloud  provider, fully aware that a backup of all data is physically stored in a data  center in India. While the legal location of the provider would be Ireland, the  political location would be the U.S. and the physical location would be India,  logically, all data could still be in Germany." Such an arrangement  would require all data to be encrypted with keys in Germany.</li>
</ul>
<p>"None of the types of data location solves  the data residency problem alone," Casper concluded. "The future will  be hybrid — organizations will be using multiple locations with multiple  service delivery models. IT leaders can structure the discussion with various  stakeholders, but eventually, it's the business leader who has to make a  decision, based on the input from general counsel, compliance officers, the  information security team, privacy professionals and the CIO."</p>
