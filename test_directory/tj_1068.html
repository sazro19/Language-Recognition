<p>A high school  in Philadelphia is in the process of moving its students off Mac laptops and onto  Chromebooks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scienceleadership.org/" target="_blank">Science Leadership Academy</a> is a college-prep school whose curriculum focuses heavily on STEM education and entrepreneurship. The school, whose instructional strategy is  inquiry-based, is operated as a partnership between the <a href="http://www.phila.k12.pa.us/" target="_blank">School District of Philadelphia</a> and the <a href="http://www2.fi.edu/" target="_blank">Franklin Institute</a>, an organization that operates a science and technology museum center and conducts various outreach and educational programs. It also partners with public schools on STEM equity initiatives.</p>
<p>SLA is a 1-to-1 district, with students and teachers currently using Apple MacBooks and tablets and Dell laptops, tablets and all-in-ones. (Teachers will continue using Dell tablets and all-in-ones.) The MacBooks have been in place in the school for about seven years.</p>
<p>But in the next few weeks, the school will begin rolling out <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/chromebook-11/pd" target="_blank">Dell Chromebooks</a> to current freshmen. The full, schoolwide rollout will take place over the next few years, with each new freshman class receiving their Chromebooks.</p>

<p>According to Dell, the transition had actually begun earlier this year, with teachers and students shifting over to Google technologies, including Google Apps (for presentations, word processing and the like), in the Chrome environment.</p>
<p>"We knew that for students to truly be in charge of their learning, we had to provide them with a device where they can research, collaborate and create projects that develop the critical thinking skills they need for future success," said Chris Lehmann, founding principal, the Science Leadership Academy, in a prepared statement. "The Dell Chromebook 11 gives our students access to their apps and content from anywhere and enables us to integrate learning into every facet of student lives, whether in the classroom, in a lab or at home."</p>

<p>The devices themselves are Dell's new Chromebook 11 models, which just started shipping this month. They're powered by a dual-core, 1.4 GHz Intel Celeron 2955U processor and sport 4 GB of onboard DDR3 memory and an LED-backlit, 11.6-inch screen with a resolution of 1,366 x 768 powered by Intel HD graphics. The devices will support 802.11a/b/g/n WiFi and will include Bluetooth 4.0.</p>
<p>Other features include:</p>
<ul>
<li> 16 GB embedded solid state drive with a boot time of about 8 seconds;</li>
<li> SD card slot for removable storage;</li>
<li> HDMI port supporting 1080p video output;</li>
<li>Front-facing 720p HD camera;</li>
<li>Dual USB 3.0 ports;</li>
<li>Two 2 watt speakers; and</li>
<li>10-hour batter life.</li>
</ul>
<p>He added: "Our mission at SLA is to help our students to become the fully realized citizens our society needs by immersing them in an inquiry-driven, project-based environment that encourages them to find their passion. The Chromebook gives us the flexibility to achieve that goal."</p>
<p>"As SLA's founding partner, The Franklin Institute is deeply committed to this unique and successful partnership," said Dennis M. Wint, president and CEO of the Franklin Institute, also in a prepared statement. "The Institute provides extraordinary opportunities for SLA students, including memberships, collaborative events and programs, board of trustee scholarships and unprecedented exposure to some of the best scientists in the world."</p>
