<p>A new web program by <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> allows users to explore the world in virtual reality (VR) by just speaking the name of a place.</p>
<p><a href="https://speaktogo.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank">Speak to Go</a> is activated by a user’s voice. When a user says the name of a place, <a href="https://www.google.com/streetview/" target="_blank">Google Street View</a> imagery pops up on one’s phone or web browser. For example, <a href="http://www.freetech4teachers.com/p/about-richard-byrne-and-free-technology.html#.WPZfB5IuqaY" target="_blank">Richard Byrne</a>, who writes the blog <a href="http://www.freetech4teachers.com/" target="_blank">Free Technology for Teachers</a>, recently spoke the word “Maine,” and was taken to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/acad/index.htm" target="_blank">Acadia National Park</a> in Maine. Had he been more specific and said “Portland, Maine,” he would have seen imagery of Portland, he said.</p>

<p>Speak to Go is designed to be used with smartphones inside of VR headsets, such as the <a href="https://vr.google.com/cardboard/" target="_blank">Google Cardboard</a>. However, it can also be used in the Chrome web browser if the user allows access to his/her microphone. The imagery isn’t as immersive in the web version as in the VR version, but it is still decent, Byrne said.</p>
<p>Even in other browsers and without a VR headset, users can explore random locations in the world by clicking on “Try it without a headset” and tapping the space bar or the phone screen. A location pops up, and a 360-degree view is provided. Users can navigate perspectives either by clicking and dragging on a web browser or moving around with a phone. Clicking on arrows allows further mobility and exploration. Random locations include <a href="http://niagarafallsusa.org" target="_blank">Niagara Falls</a>, the <a href="http://www.tajmahal.gov.in" target="_blank">Taj Mahal</a> and Mont Blanc massif (mountain range) in France. </p>
<p>In education, Speak to Go is a quick and easy option for exploring VR imagery without the need to touch a screen or click a command. In the web version, Speak to Go makes Street View imagery slightly more accessible to the average user.</p>
