<p><a href="http://www.netgear.com/" target="_blank">Netgear</a> has enhanced its new ProSAFE <a href="http://www.netgear.com/business/products/wireless/business-wireless/WAC730.aspx" target="_blank">WAC730</a> and <a href="http://www.netgear.com/business/products/wireless/business-wireless/WAC720.aspx" target="_blank">WAC720</a> 802.11ac wireless access points (APs) to support controller management through the ProSAFE <a href="http://www.netgear.com/business/products/wireless/wireless-management/wc7600.aspx" target="_blank">WC7600</a> and <a href="http://www.netgear.com/business/products/wireless/wireless-management/wc9500.aspx" target="_blank">WC9500</a> controllers.</p>
<p>The
company first launched the WAC730 and WAC720 APs in October 2015. The
WAC730 is a business-class 3x3 dual band wireless AP, and the WAC720 is
a business-class 2x2 dual band wireless AP. Both APs feature quad-mode
operation, which offers four different management modes: standalone,
ensemble, controller and cloud-managed. Netgear has released a firmware
update for the ProSAFE WC7600 and WC9500 controllers, so they now
support centralized management of the WAC730 and WAC720 APs.</p>

<p>According
to Netgear, combining quad-mode operation with controller management
offers significant benefits. "For most in the education sector,
standalone access points are not feasible as configuration changes
become routine," said Peter Newton, senior director of product
management for Netgear, in a prepared statement. "Quad mode allows
customers to decide their chosen mode of management. Through these APs,
customers can select from Standalone, Ensemble and now Controller
Management. This additional deployment flexibility allows the network
to evolve without needing to rip and replace APs to support different
management options."</p>
<p>Controller management lets educational
institutions manage the APs centrally, while ensemble mode lets them
migrate from standalone APs to a managed solution at a "pay-as-you-grow
pace," so schools can scale up the number of APs on their network to
support increasing device density as needed. </p>
<p>Key features of the ProSAFE WAC730 and WAC720 APs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregate throughput of up to 1.7 Gbps for the WAC730 and 1.2 Gbps for the WAC720;</li>
<li>3x3
    (transmit x receive) with 3 streams of data for the WAC730 and 2x2
    (transmit x receive) with 2 streams of data for the WAC720;</li>
<li>Dual-band concurrent operation with backward compatibility to 802.11n;</li>
<li>Power over Ethernet (802.2af);</li>
<li>Free ensemble management for groups of up to 10 APs of the same model; and</li>
<li>WPA, WPA2 and MAC address access list.</li>
</ul>
<p>The
ProSAFE WAC730 and WAC720 APs are compatible with the ProSAFE WC7600
and WC9500 wireless controllers. The WC7600 can manage up to 50 APs in
a single unit and up to 150 APs in a management cluster of 3
controllers, and the WC9500 can manage up to 200 APs in a single unit
and up to 600 APs in a management cluster of three controllers.</p>
