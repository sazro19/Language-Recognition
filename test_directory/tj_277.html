<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> What are your thoughts on education technology today, and what do you talk about when you go to ed tech conferences?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Leslie Fisher:</strong> We’ve always been surrounded by technology. If you look back, people were looking at what early technology could do in the classroom. We’ve always had it. It’s always going to change.</p>
<p>In one hour, I can talk about the tools you can use tomorrow. The tools teachers could deploy in their classrooms that enhance student engagement, and even teacher engagement.</p>
<p>I’ll talk about something that I think could make a good, quick, positive impact. I just talked to a conference today in Ohio. And I recently talked to another group — they need virtual reality. I got to smaller conferences and do consulting, even professional development.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> How would you describe ISTE to someone who’s not that familiar with the conference?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fisher:</strong> What I would say is, ISTE is the closest thing you can get to an education technology rock concert. You’re not going to get any more choices than ISTE. There are tons of presenters, educators and vendors. It’s a big deal. And for the attendee, you are not drinking through a fire hose, you’re drinking through a fire hydrant. It’s a great chance to hang out with other educators and learn what they’re doing. It’s a wonderful opportunity for varied learning.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> <a href="https://www.google.com/chromebook/" target="_blank">Chromebooks</a> have been steadily gaining popularity in the K–12 classroom. Which do you prefer — the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad/" target="_blank">iPad</a> or the Chromebook?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fisher:</strong> If I had a dollar every time people asked me that. It’s a tough one for me. I prefer a keyboard, and I prefer something affordable. It’s true that younger hands work best with the iPad. But it gets down to the individual learner. With the Chromebook, be prepared to put something on there that makes it more dynamic. On the creativity side, it’s a little lacking with the Chromebook. But <a href="http://www.adobe.com" target="_blank">Adobe</a> recently <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2017/01/24/google-rolls-out-new-chromebooks-allows-access-to-android-adobe-apps.aspx" target="_blank">made some of their apps available to the Chromebook</a>, so those are definitely worth checking out.</p>
