<p>School IT provider <a href="https://www.imperosoftware.com/" target="_blank">Impero Software</a> is debuting Impero Education Pro 6 at the <a href="http://fetc.org/" target="_blank">FETC conference</a>, taking place this week in Orlando, FL. Impero Education Pro is a suite of tools offering classroom and network management capabilities for schools, along with web filtering, desktop management and monitoring, inventory management and tracking, print management, power management and patch management, among other capabilities.</p>
<p>The latest version adds Impero Insight as an add-on. Insight is a cloud-based analytics and reporting tool for school districts designed to help administrators visualize safety and other school environment data. According to Impero CEO Sam Pemberton, it provides "cloud-based reporting  across multiple servers, allowing larger schools and Multi-Academy Trusts to  take advantage of a highly usable top level view of data with the ability to  drill down to a school, class or student level. The managed policy system will  make auto-updates to our keyword libraries seamless, ensuring that schools are  always up to date with the latest safeguarding terms, based on our ongoing  exhaustive research."</p>
