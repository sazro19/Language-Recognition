<p>Huntsville, AL-based Alatec has acquired education IT service provider USi as a wholly owned subsidiary. The new combined company has been rebranded as <a href="http://ignitenow.net/" target="_blank">Ignite</a>.</p>
<p>According to Ignite, the move was designed to allow the business to offer a wider range of services to customers and expand into other areas. USi provided IT , systems and software engineering services to local schools, as well as federal and private sector organizations. Alatec had primarily served federal agencies and defense. Ignite operates in 17 states.</p>
<p>"USi is  a significant part of igniting our own innovation in that they are a younger  company on the leading edge of education information technology," said Jason  Shelton, Ignite president and CEO, in a prepared statement. "The model USi has facilitated for local  schools is one we can replicate from a business standpoint to carry over into  other offerings, allowing us to innovate and be ahead of the curve." </p>
<p>"The  acquisition benefits USi customers because we can provide a broader array of  services, including cyber, modeling and simulation, training, and technology  services," said Clayton Hinchman, Ignite COO, also in a prepared statement. "We solve problems differently,  and we will continue to be different in the way we approach customer problems  and solutions." </p>
