<p><a href="https://www.intervision.com/" target="_blank">InterVision</a>, a strategic IT service provider, is strengthening its consulting business through the acquisition of <a href="https://www.fotisnetworks.com/" target="_blank">Fotis Networks</a>.</p>
<p>Fotis works with educational institutions to conceptualize, design and build out solutions focused around cloud computing and security.  Past projects include creating Campus Area Networks and implementing capacity planning and monitoring solutions.</p>
<p>"Our clients are moving into more complex environments that require greater expertise in cloud services, security, enterprise infrastructure and compliance to name a few," said Aaron Stone, president and CEO of InterVision. "Fotis brings technical depth in these areas and complements our current engineering talent. Coming together as one organization allows us to service our clients in the most effective manner."</p>
<p>"The natural synergy between Fotis and InterVision is the result of mutual respect, shared values, and experience working together on complex client deployments," said Frank Loulourgas, founder and CEO of Fotis. "Joining the InterVision team enhances our collective ability to deliver the best client outcomes." </p>
