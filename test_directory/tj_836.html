<p>Apple has chosen 114 schools to  receive a share of $100 million in grants to provide curriculum support,  wireless infrastructure and classroom technology, such as iPads and MacBooks.</p>
<p>The grants are Apple's  contribution to the White House's <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/k-12/connected/" target="_blank">ConnectED  Intiative</a>, which aims to bring technology into classrooms and improve  broadband access from 30 percent of schools to 99 percent by 2017.</p>
<p>"Apple's grants are an important part of  meeting President Obama's goal to have 99 percent of all classrooms connected  to broadband in five years or fewer. This will go a long way to help level the  playing field for our country's students and ensuring equity," said <a href="http://www.nea.org/" target="_blank">National Education Association</a> President Lily Eskelsen García,  in a prepared statement. "More to the point, the  $100 million in grants will help schools — especially high-needs schools — reach  the level of accessibility needed for our students to learn, create, and  ultimately, compete in the 21st century economy."</p>

<p>Each of the schools chosen, representing  29 states, has a student body that qualifies for free or reduced lunch at a  rate of at least 96 percent. Ninety-two percent of the combined student body of  the recipient schools "are of Hispanic, black, Native American,  Alaskan Native or Asian heritage," according to information on <a href="https://www.apple.com/education/connectED/" target="_blank">Apple's ConnectED</a> page.</p>
<p>"Technology paired with passionate and  well-supported teachers enables deeper creativity and learning," the site  adds. "That's why every student at our ConnectED schools will receive an  iPad, allowing students to connect with topics and express themselves like  never before. Every teacher and administrator will receive an iPad and a Mac to  help support and inspire their students. And every ConnectED classroom will  have an Apple TV to help students immerse themselves in the educational content  they discover and the work they create."</p>
<p>The company will also assign an  Apple Education team to each school to make sure their needs are considered and  strategies implemented effectively. A professional development specialist will  help ensure that the technology is implemented appropriately.</p>
<p>In addition, Apple has partnered  with providers of educational content, cellular and Wi-Fi access, classroom  workflow tools and mobile device management to ensure access to "tailored  curriculum solutions at no cost to the schools."</p>
<p>"As a participant in the selection  process, NASSP congratulates those schools and wishes them well on the exciting  journey ahead" said JoAnn Bartoletti, executive director of the <a href="http://www.principals.org/" target="_blank">National Association of Secondary School  Principals</a> (NASSP), in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>"NASSP has <a href="http://www.principals.org/Content.aspx?topic=Using_Mobile_and_Social_Technologies_in_Schools" target="_blank">long  promoted the power of mobile technology to enhance student learning,</a> and has  been deeply committed to ensuring that schools are able to take full advantage  of their technology," continued Bartoletti. "We are delighted that  Apple shares this goal. Apple will provide ongoing professional development and  ensure a sufficient broadband infrastructure—essential elements of the genuine  digital conversion to which these schools aspire. This very much reflects the  comprehensive approach to technology that our <a href="http://www.nassp.org/digitalprincipal" target="_blank">NASSP Digital Principal Award</a> winners practice in their schools."</p>
