<p><a href="http://allovue.com/" target="_blank">Allovue</a>, an education finance technology company, has launched a new budgeting product for school districts. <a href="http://allovue.com/products/balance/budget" target="_blank">Balance Budget</a>, part of the <a href="http://allovue.com/products/balance" target="_blank">Balance software platform</a>, was built to simplify the time-consuming process of creating and managing district budgets across central office departments and schools.</p>
<p>“We heard from district finance offices of every shape and size that budgeting is their biggest challenge, and nothing on the market was meeting their needs,” said Allovue’s Chief Executive Officer and Founder Jess Gartner in a statement.</p>
<p>Allovue recruited the executive director of budget and finance from <a href="https://www.dpsk12.org" target="_blank">Denver Public Schools</a>, Kate Kotaska, to help design the product.</p>

<p>With Balance Budget, budget directors can allocate resources to decision-makers throughout the district without having to manage many custom, static spreadsheets. Title I grant managers, teaching and learning departments and school principals can now all manage their allocations to budget staff and other resources that are aligned to district goals, Allovue said in a news release.</p>
<p>Balance Budget’s real-time data updates are designed to keep budget directors informed and involved as the whole district community engages in as thoughtful budgeting process, making reporting to the board and other executive staff members easy and accurate at all times, according to the release. Late-stage changes to salary and benefits packages can be updated across dozens or hundreds of budgets with a few keystrokes.</p>
<p>Balance Budget is now available for purchase or <a href="http://allovue.com/products/balance/budget" target="_blank">demo</a> and several of Allovue’s current partners, including <a href="http://www.myips.org" target="_blank">Indianapolis Public Schools</a>, will be using it to streamline their budget process this year, the company said.</p>
