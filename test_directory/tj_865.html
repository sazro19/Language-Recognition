<p class="deck" id="ph_pcontent3_3_Deck">This week's tutorial covers a number functions in Google's Spreadsheet app, Google Sheets. Here we take a practical look at using weekdays in calculations, introduce "if" statements and learn how to refer dynamically to the contents of a current cell.</p>

<p>In a previous Google Apps tutorial, we looked at a method for formatting spreadsheet cells  based on a date. If a date were X days in the future, the cell and text would appear in a certain color. If it were Y days in the future, they would be a different color.</p>
<p>Then a reader wrote to me asking if it would be possible to exclude weekends when making such calculations. In other words, can we format a cell conditionally using only school days, business days or work days as a reference?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Within the Conditional Formatting function, Google has provided the option of using custom formulas. These custom formulas are what you'll have to use in order to make this thing work.</p>
<p><strong>NETWORKDAYS</strong><br/>
Weekdays (school days, business days) are calculated using the NETWORKDAYS. If you want to count the number of net working days between today and a week from today (inclusive of today), you could simply enter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>=NETWORKDAYS(TODAY(),TODAY()+7)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This should yield an answer of 6 if today is a weekday, 5 if today is a weekend day.</p>
<p>We can also use this feature in conditional formatting. But we'll need to do quite a bit more work on it first.</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong><br/>
Using IF, we can get Google sheets to return  one value if a statement is true and another if the statement is false. To help you understand how this works conceptually, try plugging this into a cell in one of your spreadsheets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>=if(NETWORKDAYS(TODAY(),TODAY()+7)=6,"Today is a weekday","Today is a weekend day")</p>
</blockquote>
<table border="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img alt="conditional formatting in Goole Sheets" height="173" src="/-/media/EDU/THEJournal/Images/2014/09/20140923a2.jpg" width="644"/><br/>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>That's a simple test to determine if today is a weekday or not. The formula simply says if the number of net working days from today to seven days from today is 6, then display "Today is a weekday"; if not, display "Today is a weekend day." (Note: If you plan to output text, the text must appear within quotation marks in this expression.)</p>
<p>The answer will change depending on which day you view your spreadsheet, since we used the dynamic value "TODAY()."</p>
<p>You can also used fixed dates in the same way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>=if(NETWORKDAYS(DATE(2014,9,22),DATE(2014,9,29))=6,"Today is September 22, 2014","You typed something wrong")</p>
</blockquote>
<table border="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img alt="conditional formatting in Goole Sheets" height="136" src="/-/media/EDU/THEJournal/Images/2014/09/20140923a3.jpg" width="644"/><br/>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>That particular one will always display "Today is September 22, 2014" ... unless you typed something wrong in the formula.  (As I began writing this, the date was, in fact, Sept. 22, 2014.)</p>
<p>In addition to =, you can also use &lt; and &gt; in your if statements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>=if(NETWORKDAYS(TODAY(),TODAY()+7)&lt;6,"Today is a weekend day","Today is a weekday")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So: If the number of days from today to a week from today is less than 6, today is a weekend; otherwise it's a weekday.</p>
<p>And, importantly for today's tutorial, you can also output the result as a number, instead of a string of text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>=if(NETWORKDAYS(TODAY(),TODAY()+7)&lt;6,1,0)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here 1 will be displayed if the statement is true; 0 will be displayed if it's false.</p>
