<p>The second annual “<a href="http://stateofthestates.educationsuperhighway.org/" target="_blank">State of the States</a>” <a href="http://stateofthestates.educationsuperhighway.org/" target="_blank">report</a> on the state of broadband connectivity in United States schools finds a number of states are leading the way in ensuring that their students have access to equal educational opportunities provided by technology.</p>
<p>The report was issued Monday by <a href="https://www.educationsuperhighway.org" target="_blank">EducationSuperHighway</a>, a national nonprofit focused on upgrading the internet access in every public school classroom in America.</p>
<p>Among the highlights of the report, every student in Hawaii, Kentucky, North Dakota, South Carolina and Wyoming meets the minimum connectivity goal of 100 kilobits per second (kbps) per student — meaning that every child in these states can take advantage of digital learning. Meanwhile, Kentucky and Hawaii also join Delaware, Tennessee and West Virginia in having every school connected to high-speed fiber — the infrastructure that will allow their school districts to increase bandwidth over time to keep up with demand, according to a news release.</p>
