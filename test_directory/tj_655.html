The district then began putting WiFi routers on idle school buses in areas where families lacked high-speed Internet connectivity. Last November, President Obama recognized Adams’ innovative efforts at a <a href="http://tech.ed.gov/futureready/attendees/">ConnectED to the Future</a> meeting where fellow educators were discussing the importance of technology in education.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal</em></strong><strong>: One of the first things you did after becoming superintendent in 2011 was to set in motion the 1-to-1 iPad initiative. What was the impetus for that?</strong><br/>
<strong>Darryl</strong> <strong>Adams</strong>: Our students weren’t graduating prepared for college and I thought, “This is educational malpractice. We’ve got to do something different.” We knew we had to change our whole system, that we had to utilize every tool available, and one of the most important tools is technology. Why weren’t we using that? </p>

<p><strong><em>THE Journal</em></strong><strong>: You put a bond on the November 2012 ballot and ended up getting it passed with 67 percent of the vote. How did you build support in such a low-income community?</strong><br/>
<strong>Adams</strong>: I almost felt like I was running for office myself! We knew it was expensive but we said, “Let’s go to the parents and ask whether it’s important enough for you to tax yourself so that your students will have it.” We did a pilot program with about 5,000 iPads to build interest and get the teachers, students and parents excited, then we put it on the ballot and the people said, “We’re not going to wait for the government or anyone else; we’re going to tax ourselves so our students have a better future.”</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal</em></strong><strong>: What were the challenges to implementing the program?</strong><br/>
<strong>Adams</strong>: We had to train our teachers before the students got their devices. We had formed a group of about 120 who worked with the iPads and their students during the pilot phase, starting in January 2012, so we had time to make sure that our teachers were well versed in how to use the devices and that they would then help the other teachers see how important it was. Then we had to make sure we had the WiFi infrastructure to handle that many devices and that the connectivity was state-of-the-art, so we rebuilt the whole system from the funds that we got from the bond.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal</em></strong><strong>: And then you realized you needed to do more than have the students connected at school?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adams</strong>: It was a $42 million bond, and the initial $22 million went to buy the devices and rebuild the infrastructure. But what I was seeing was parents were bringing students in and parking at the school at night so they could connect, or parking at the district office on the weekends so that they could connect. We have a lot of trailer-home parks, and we knew that some students may not have connectivity there. About 30 to 40 percent were not connected. So we said, “Let’s put the router on the bus and park it in those non-connectivity areas when it’s not being used. At first we ran into a problem because the battery runs down — you can’t just leave the bus on — so we decided to put solar panels on the bus, and that’s worked out brilliantly.</p>
