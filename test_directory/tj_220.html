<p>The latest  fight for net neutrality has officially begun. On one side of the ring stands FCC  Chairman Ajit Pai, a Trump appointee who controls a majority of votes for any decisions  currently made by the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Communications Commission</a>. He's backed by the three major companies  that deliver Internet services in America: AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon. Facing  them off on the other side stands a self-described "ragtag" coalition  of web content providers — some 70,000 at last count — who are declaring the "last  stand" for net neutrality.</p>
<p>As people go  online today, they'll be alerted by prominent messages on sites as varied as Google,  Facebook, Amazon, Airbnb, Netflix, Kickstarter, Dropbox, the American Library Association,  Green Peace and Chess.com warning against "big ISPs" that plan a future  filled with "traffic throttling, site blocking and new fees."</p>
<p>Later this  summer, the FCC is expected to schedule a final vote on its planned changes to  the net neutrality rules. In May the agency requested feedback on its proposed  rulemaking, which it titled with the positive-sounding, "Restoring  Internet Freedom for All Americans." At its heart is a proposal to reverse  a 2015 rule that classified the internet as a utility. So far, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/filings?proceedings_name=17-108&amp;sort=date_disseminated,DESC" target="_blank">6 million comments</a> have been sent to the FCC, nearly  75,000 per day since the proposed changes were first taken up by Pai.</p>

<p>The core  of net neutrality is the idea that broadband providers must grant access to all  content and applications, without blocking, slowing or otherwise discriminating  against any websites or online services. If the current regulations are  weakened, opponents have suggested, some websites will work better than others.  For example, "Comcast might choose to slow Netflix traffic since it owns  NBC, a part-owner of Hulu, which is a Netflix competitor," explained <a href="https://maplight.org/" target="_blank">MapLight.com</a>, a non-profit that investigates  the influence of money in politics, in a recent article. The likelihood of that  scenario isn't out of the question. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/29/13774648/fcc-att-zero-rating-directv-net-neutrality-vs-tmobile" target="_blank">the Verge reported last year</a>, AT&amp;T wooed wireless customers  by offering them unlimited access to DirecTV Now, a service provided by the  satellite TV subsidiary owned by the company. (The deal has since been modified  to impose a throttle after 22 GB of data usage.)</p>

<p>One of the banners that will appear on sites today in support of net neutrality.</p>

<p>MapLight  said the stakes for the three telecom companies and its public voice, the  National Cable TV &amp; Telecommunications Association, are high. Since 2008  they've poured an estimated $572 million into lobbying the federal government  for favorable regulations, a tally that equates to spending the equivalent of  almost $100 for every one of those net neutrality comments.</p>
<p>Many of  those public statements, however, are being generated automatically, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/a-bot-is-flooding-the-fccs-website-with-fake-anti-net-neutrality-comments/" target="_blank">as PC Magazine reported last month</a>. On the side of sticking with the  current rules are filings that begin, "I don't want [internet service  providers] to have the power to block websites, slow them down, give some sites  an advantage over others or split the Internet into 'fast lanes' for companies  that pay and 'slow lanes' for the rest. Now is not the time to let giant ISPs  censor what we see and do online." Many of the comments from those who  support the proposed changes use this text: "The unprecedented regulatory  power the Obama Administration imposed on the internet is smothering  innovation, damaging the American economy and obstructing job creation. I urge  the Federal Communications Commission to end the bureaucratic regulatory overreach  of the internet known as Title II and restore the bipartisan light-touch  regulatory consensus that enabled the internet to flourish for more than 20  years. The plan currently under consideration at the FCC to repeal Obama's  Title II power grab is a positive step forward and will help to promote a truly  free and open internet for everyone."</p>
