<p>"As schools make the transition to more technology-enabled classrooms, they have discovered that there is a big difference between using commercially available computers and deploying systems built specifically to facilitate digital learning," said Scott MacDonald, vice president and general manager at RGS, in a prepared statement. "The RGS Education Chromebook is designed to provide the durability to withstand the hazards of K-12 classroom use, as well as ease-of-use and learning-centric functionality districts require, with a lower cost of ownership and all the associated support services needed to not only optimize system performance and instruction time, but to support the ultimate goal of improving learning outcomes." </p>
