<p>A California-based coding and STEAM camp is expanding its tech summer camps to more locations this summer — in the Golden State and on the East Coast.</p>
<p>In Southern California, <a href="https://www.coderevkids.com" target="_blank">CodeREV</a> will have new locations in Westwood, Orange, Mission Viejo/Aliso Viejo and Point Loma (San Diego). In Northern California, new CodeREV camps will launch in Sunnyside and Outer Sunset (San Francisco), West San Jose and Mountain View. </p>
<p>The tech camp company — headquartered in Santa Monica — will also start a new location in Nantucket, MA, this summer. Previous locations in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Encino, Irvine and Del Mar/Solana Beach will continue running this summer.</p>
<p>CodeREV’s mission is to get more students coding and involved in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, math) activities, rather than risk losing critical skills over the summer break. </p>

<p>The camps are geared toward first to ninth graders, and are designed to teach marketable skills like coding, robotics, higher order thinking, game development and math. </p>
<p>Evan Boorman, 35, started the company almost three years ago after running a successful tutoring company. He spoke with <em>THE Journal</em> to discuss the CodeREV camps, as well as the necessities of teaching coding and STEAM to young people. </p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> Why did you start CodeREV?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Evan Boorman:</strong> I really saw this as a space that needed addressing, something that I believed in for a while. When I thought the culture and the winds of what people were saying started to agree with that thinking, I kind of jumped full-gear into this space.</p>
<p>We are doing coding education, programming, engineering and robotics education for kids. We’re doing that through various formats, including the camp space.</p>

<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> Describe your tutoring company experience, and how that led you to CodeREV.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Boorman:</strong> I started a tutoring company directly out of college. We had 25 tutors by the time I left three years ago. We were covering mainly STEM-related subjects — science, math, the GMAT. We were helping kids to get into great colleges and do well in school. It was very meaningful.</p>
<p>I felt like we were making a difference. Especially around the time of the recession, I felt like there were all these students we helped to get into these great colleges. Then they were graduating college and not finding good jobs.</p>
<p>I also encountered all these friends who learned to program earlier in life. They were at a variety of different software companies — <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, senior engineers for <a href="https://www.blackline.com" target="_blank">BlackLine</a> — and they were making great money and happy with what they were doing. I thought, “Why are we not teaching our kids this? Why is this not included when we’re helping kids in all these different subjects?” And I teamed up with a couple of buddies and learned to program with them as they taught me along the way, to build a website together.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> Why are you doing the CodeREV camps? Why is it important?</strong></p>
<p>Because it’s fun. Kids ages 6-15 are broken up into groups, based on classes that they signed up for. We have 14 different classes that are all around project-based learning. They’re building fun projects using programming, engineering, robotics or digital art. So we teach everything from app creators, where they learn to build apps, using software from <a href="http://web.mit.edu" target="_blank">MIT</a>, to web development. Kids create their own multi-page websites. They build them in HTML and Java script. They learn practical skills — that’s one of the reasons that parents like it.</p>
