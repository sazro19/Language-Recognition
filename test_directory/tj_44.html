<p><a href="https://www.catchon.com/">CatchOn</a>,
an education technology company that produces a data analytics
utility for measuring usage of applications through the network for
the purposes of tracking technology investments, has introduced a
module to generate <a href="https://www.catchon.com/student-level-data/">student-level
data</a>.
The new tool helps educators monitor when and how each student uses
online tools and resources on his or her school-owned device.</p>
<p>The
student-level data module lets the school or district:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Track
    student activity within a given course, section or assigned
    applications and evaluate time spent on tasks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measure
    student access to online applications and learning management tools,
    determine if students are online when they are outside school
    buildings and track student access to applications that aren't
    approved or vetted for privacy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyze
    usage within a class, section or grade level and compare user
    engagement to identify gaps or inconsistencies in activities for
    assigned applications; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Produce
    reports to share engagement statistics across the school or
    district.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>"The
student-level data module offers additional clarity regarding
students' usage of tools and resources to ensure they are engaged and
receiving the right support," said Jena Draper, founder of
CatchOn, in a press release. "Having access to real-time and
easy to understand, intelligible data and reporting is now more
critical than ever to formulate effective instructional strategies.
That is why we are so excited to offer this new student-level data
module that enables districts to identify how their online resources
are being used to ensure their students are engaged and not falling
through the cracks."</p>
