<p><a href="http://www.mvla.net/" target="_blank">Mountain View Los Altos Union High School District</a> (MVLA) has beefed up the wireless network at <a href="http://www.mvla.net/MVHS/" target="_blank">Mountain  View High School</a> (MVHS) to cope with a 560 percent increase in network  usage following the deployment of more than 2,000 Chromebooks.</p>
<p>The looming adoption of the  Common Core State Standards and the technology and assessment requirements that  go along with them led the district to reassess its technology and wireless  infrastructure needs in fall 2013. With approximately 1,800 students and only  around 300 Chromebooks, district administrators realized they needed many more  devices.</p>
<p>"We went from 300 Chromebooks  district-wide at the end of the last school year to more than 2,000 today,"  said Mike Mathiesen, associate superintendent at Mountain View High  School, in a prepared statement. "We sought a wireless provider that  could support our new requirements for density and capacity, as well as the  ability to scale to match our future growth plans."</p>

<p>The district's network was also  not up to the challenge, with inconsistent access depending on location and an  inability to scale up for the looming explosion in demand.</p>
<p>"We found that if too  many devices connected to an access point, at some point everyone would  simultaneously lose connectivity," said Mathiesen. "It was adequate  when it was first put in four years ago, but as the number of devices  connecting grew, it became apparent that a new solution would be necessary."</p>
<p>Expecting demand to increase in  the future, MVHS turned to <a href="http://www.xirrus.com/" target="_blank">Xirrus</a> with a  plan to implement a network capable of supporting a 3:1 device-to-student  ratio. The school chose to deploy 4-radio and 8-radio high-density modular access  points (APs) offered by the company, in part to reduce installation and  operational costs associated with using a greater number of standard 2-radio  fixed APs.</p>
<p>"Administrators also  utilize Xirrus' ability to manage application usage to ensure wireless devices  are being used strictly for educational purposes during school hours,"according  to a news release. "Xirrus' Application Control puts tools in the hands of  administrators to monitor usage, prioritize critical educational applications,  and block recreational applications such as social media and gaming."</p>
<p>"LAHS expanded their wireless coverage  significantly, extending connectivity across all classrooms as well as common  and outdoor areas," said Jose Perez, director of IT infrastructure  services at MSA Systems, which partnered with the school on the upgrades "By  deploying Xirrus, LAHS ensured that their investment in wireless would be  adaptable to changing wireless requirements, significantly lengthening the  overall lifespan of their network."</p>
<p>The network upgrade and Chromebook deployment were both funded through grants from the <a href="http://mvlafoundation.org/" target="_blank">Mountain View Los Altos High School Foundation</a> and Google.</p>
