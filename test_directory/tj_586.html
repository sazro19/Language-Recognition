<p>The <a href="http://education.ky.gov/" target="_blank">Kentucky Department of Education</a> has selected an Internet content filtering system for implementation at all 173
K-12 school districts throughout the state.</p>
<p>On August 28, 2015, the department announced that all of the state's public
school districts had achieved the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/connected" target="_blank">ConnectED initiative's</a> goal of providing
each student with 100 kilobits per second (kbps) of Internet bandwidth. With
that goal achieved, the department turned its attention to ensuring that every
student would be protected online. The department conducted a competitive
vendor selection process and chose <a href="http://www.lightspeedsystems.com/" target="_blank">Lightspeed Systems</a> to install and
implement its <a href="http://www.lightspeedsystems.com/products/web-filter/" target="_blank">Rocket Web
Filter</a> in all public school districts.</p>
<p>"All shareholders within public education understand the importance of
Internet safety," said Chuck Austin, product manager for the Kentucky
Department of Education, in a prepared statement. "We share in the
responsibility to not only emphasize digital citizenship, but also to ensure
that we have the right technology solutions which allow for safe, efficient
and secure access to the valuable resource that is the Internet."</p>
