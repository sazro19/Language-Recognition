<p>Solidworks is 3D computer-aided design (CAD) software commonly used by
engineers and designers in industry. Solidworks Education Edition is designed to
help students learn 3D CAD, simulation, product data management, technical
communication and electrical design. According to the company, "Solidworks
training, education and certification are major assets validating student
expertise to prospective employers." </p>
<p>New features in the 2014-2015 education edition are intended to increase
collaborative learning, shorten student design processes and help teachers

<li>Path Dimension, a key sketch feature for robot and FSAE teams that need
    to design with chains and belts;</li>
<li>Curve-Driven Patterns, a feature that enables faster and easier creation
    of patterns, such as chains and conveyor system; and</li>
<li>Assembly Explode, to add rotational explode to components and more
    clearly and effectively communicate product assembly processes on drawings
    and in animations.</li>

<p>Schools can also purchase Solidworks Electrical, which is fully integrated
into Solidworks Education Edition and "enables students in engineering, robotics
and other disciplines to create electrical projects starting with 2D system
schematics and ending with 3D routing and cabling interconnecting components,"
according to the company. </p>
<p>The company offers free Solidworks Student Edition licenses to qualifying
schools. The student edition licenses allow students to use the software outside
the classroom. Schools with Education Edition subscriptions can also become <a href="http://www.solidworks.com/sw/support/cswa-academic.htm" target="_blank">Certified
