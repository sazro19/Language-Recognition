<p>K–12 and community colleges will get a taste of the power of  networking services delivered by <a href="http://www.internet2.edu/" target="_blank">Internet2</a>,  at least in North Carolina. Under a new proof-of-concept program, schools,  districts and community colleges in that state will specifically be able to try  out Internet2's identity management service, <a href="http://www.internet2.edu/products-services/trust-identity/incommon-federation/" target="_blank">InCommon  Federated Identity Management</a>. FIM, as it's called, is intended to reduce  the number of passwords users need to remember, offers new opportunities to  share services and software and gives a more seamless transition between one  educational organization and another.</p>
<p>The pilot is being undertaken by <a href="https://www.mcnc.org/" target="_blank">MCNC</a>, a North Carolina non-profit that  connects the institutions of higher education, including those within the <a href="https://www.northcarolina.edu/" target="_blank">University of North Carolina System</a>, <a href="https://www.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Duke</a> and <a href="http://www.wfu.edu/" target="_blank">Wake  Forest</a>. The education network also hooks into Internet2 along with National  Lambda Rail. Over the last several years, MCNC has opened its services up to  non-institutional organizations, including non-profit hospitals, libraries and  public safety operations.</p>

<p>Internet2 allowed the InCommon service to begin examining  outreach to K–12 and community colleges through an "<a href="https://www.incommon.org/steward/" target="_blank">InCommon Steward</a>" program.  MCNC will act as a steward to vet the district and community college and  operate the identity management infrastructure for those constituents.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.incommon.org/steward/StewardCommunityReview.pdf" target="_blank">a  presentation on the steward community program</a> explained, the advantages are  particularly stark as schools move to the cloud for their services. FIM will  support access to cloud applications using local authentication systems; it  will simplify role-based authorization at scale; and the existing set-up for  the InCommon Federation software base, standards and operational processes will  "make it all work."</p>
<p>"Trying to extend InCommon to all of K-14 education  nationally would be too large to scale. We knew we had to work with our  regional network partners that have these key relationships built in,"  said Ann West, associate vice president for trust and identity at Internet2, in  a statement. "InCommon puts the trust in trusted networks, and we're so  grateful that MCNC is collaborating with us on a workable solution that  benefits both education and the regionals." She added that the work is  "generating a lot of interest from other states who are watching this very  closely."</p>
