Implementing, maintaining and  managing computer technology has been extremely difficult for most K-12  educational systems. The sometimes-impressive facade of computers gracing  desktops in many schools obscures a more sobering reality that educational  technology is often so unreliable its utility to students and teachers is negated.  Consequently, opportunities for significant  productivity gains from educational technology including pedagogical advances,  closing the achievement gap and facilitating K-12 reforms have gone unrealized.</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, education  technology appears poised to make major contributions to K-12 education.  Increasingly, research finds that  technology can make a positive  impact on educational performance (for example, see the meta-analytical studies  by Cheung &amp; Slavin; 2012, 2013, Zheng et. al., 2016). Moreover, a growing  body of evidence now suggests that when systematically implemented, educational  technology can support a wide range of educational innovations, including  flipped classrooms, peer-to-peer teaching, and customized learning.</p>

<h5> The Education Technology Challenge</h5>
<p>
However, the prolonged  implementation phase of K-12 educational technology is not exceptional when  compared with other transformative technologies, such as steam power,  electricity and earlier generations of computing.  Steam power took approximately 80 years from  Watts's first steam engine to realize significant gains in manufacturing  productivity (Crafts, 2004). In a similar manner, electric power took approximately  40 years before electric dynamo technology yielded dramatic increases in  manufacturing productivity (David, 1991). More recently, the failure to  identify productivity gains from the massive investments in computing  technology by American businesses was labeled a as "productivity paradox," a  perception that changed dramatically after the mid 1990s. </p>
<p>
Why did it take so long to realize  productivity gains from these different transformative technologies? </p>
<p>
David (1991) concluded that lags in  productivity were owing to:</p>
<ol>
<li>The initial unprofitability of replacing existing  functioning technology;</li>
<li>The need to identify and integrate complementary  technical components; and</li>
<li>The need to integrate the new technology into organizational  processes (David, 1991).  </li>
</ol>
<p>Today, challenges to the successful  introduction of educational technology into the K-12 system are similar to those  faced by previous transformative technologies because success requires  implementation of an entire system of technological and organizational  innovation, not just a single stand-alone invention. </p>
<p>
Given the significant opportunities offered by educational technology, a major  policy question facing the United States today is how to optimize its potential  in the quickest and fairest way possible for the entire K-12 system.  To examine  this challenge, we have adopted a technology value chain framework. The  framework is designed to: </p>
<ol>
<li>Identify  bottlenecks in educational technology implementation initiatives that have  impeded its adoption in the past; and</li>
<li>Assess the  readiness of the K-12 system to integrate these technologies into the nation's  schools to  produce significant benefits  for students, schools and society. </li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>The Education Technology Value Chain</strong></h5>
<p>
The value chain model developed for this  analysis (see fig. 1) assesses the technological, organizational and human  capital components of the K-12 educational technology system.  The framework presented here takes an  institutional level perspective of the provision of educational technology to  K-12 schools and we examine how technological, organizational, administrative  and even demographic trends can affect the delivery of educational technology services  to K-12 schools.</p>
