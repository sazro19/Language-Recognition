<p>Compared  to 10 other comparably sized school districts in California, the one in <a href="http://www.ncsd.k12.ca.us/" target="_blank">Nevada  City</a> pays more for  its Internet and gets less. While the three-school district pays $175 per month  for 1.5 megabits per second (Mbps), <a href="http://www.maxwell.k12.ca.us/" target="_blank">Maxwell  Unified</a> in Colusa pays  $149 for 500 Mbps. <a href="http://www.ecesd.org/" target="_blank">El Centro Elementary</a> pays $54 for 12 Mbps. On the wide  area network (WAN) side, the district pays $1,379 for 100 Mbps of bandwidth  compared to $405 for 16 gigabits per second (Gbps) at <a href="http://www.chicousd.org/" target="_blank">Chico  Unified</a> and $1,232  for <a href="http://www.svusdca.org/" target="_blank">Sonoma  Valley Unified</a>'s  3 Gbps.</p>
<p>Those comparisons were generated through a new online  tool introduced by <a href="http://www.educationsuperhighway.org/" target="_blank">EducationSuperHighway  (ESH)</a>. <a href="http://www.compareandconnectk12.org/" target="_blank">Compare  &amp; Connect K-12</a> is intended to provide price transparency to help schools and districts get  more bandwidth for their broadband budgets. The organization behind the tool is  a non-profit that focuses on upgrading the Internet access available in public  schools. Its work is funded by Mark Zuckerberg's Startup: Education and the  Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.

<p>Compare  &amp; Connect K-12 uses 2015 and 2016 data pulled from the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/" target="_blank">Federal  Communications Commission's</a> E-rate program application data coupled with a painstaking confirmation process  that involved direct communication between the organization's team of analysts,  data experts and developers and 5,500 E-rate applicants, district leaders,  technology directors, state partners and E-rate consultants. The cost information  doesn't reflect E-rate discounts, since they're intended to show the total cost  of providing bandwidth for educational purposes, not what the school district  pays. In cases where state or school district people identified broadband  services not applied for through E-rate, those services were added to the  dataset "to provide a holistic view of the network architecture for a  given school district."</p>
<p>"We  built Compare &amp; Connect K-12 to create transparency around the bandwidth  school districts buy," <a href="http://www.educationsuperhighway.org/compareandconnectk12-FAQ" target="_blank">a FAQ on the website</a> explained. "We believe data  transparency is critical for two reasons: 1) It creates informed buyers at the  state and school district level who, as a result of transparency, can negotiate  more effectively to increase bandwidth for their students; and 2) It helps  track progress towards bandwidth targets that will enable all students to take  advantage of digital learning."</p>
<p>Comparisons  on the site can be done across school districts or by broadband services.  Results can be filtered by type of service, speed, type of connection, state  and service provider. The comparison tool also provides a visual image showing  how much bandwidth the district can expect to need in the future compared to  what it currently has. That calculation is based on the FCC's 2018 1  Mbps-per-student bandwidth recommendation.</p>
<p>ESH  already claims victory in its efforts to help schools negotiate better deals.  For example, <a href="http://www.gfps.k12.mt.us/" target="_blank">Great Falls Public Schools</a> in Montana used the beta version  of the tool to compare the price it was paying for its bandwidth against that  of neighboring school districts. Armed with that information, the district was  able to negotiate within its long-term contract with its existing provider and  get 330 percent more bandwidth for an additional 8 percent increase in  monthly cost.</p>
