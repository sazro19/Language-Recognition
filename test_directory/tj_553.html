<p><a href="http://www.powerschool.com/" target="_blank">PowerSchool</a> and <a href="https://www.peopleadmin.com/" target="_blank">PeopleAdmin</a> have partnered to integrate PowerSchool's student information system
(SIS) and PeopleAdmin's TalentEd Perform teacher evaluation system.</p>
<p>Schools
that use both of the information systems can now analyze their teacher
performance and effectiveness information along with their student
achievement information and potentially identify connections between
the two, according to a news release from the companies. </p>
<p>The
two companies also plan to develop single sign-on capabilities for the
systems, so users can log in once to access both the SIS and TalentEd
Perform. "The integration will make it easier for districts to access
student and teacher information, and will save principals time in
gathering student information for teacher evaluations," stated the news
release.</p>
<p>"Educators using our systems will be able to enjoy a
seamless experience as they more easily manage their daily information
needs," said Kermit Randa, CEO of PeopleAdmin, in a prepared statement.
"More broadly, we will help them leverage the power of data and
analytics to achieve improved academic results."</p>

<p>This partnership
has the potential to affect a large number of schools in the United
States. According to the companies, one third of U.S. educators and
administrators use PeopleAdmin, and 25 percent of schools use
PowerSchool.</p>
