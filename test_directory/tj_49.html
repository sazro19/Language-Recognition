<p>Plenty
of discussions about the use of artificial intelligence talk about
how AI could help educators by shrinking the amount of time they have
to spend on the trivia that pervades their work and freeing them up
to focus on the job of teaching. In the latest <a href="https://cosn.org/focus-areas/leadership-vision/it-leadership-survey">CoSN
IT leadership survey</a>,
more than half of respondents (55 percent) said that AI would have a
significant or even transformational impact on teaching and learning
within the next five years, if privacy issues can be addressed to
everybody's satisfaction.</p>
<p>In
a <a href="https://s23.a2zinc.net/clients/cosn/cosn2020/public/SessionDetails.aspx?FromPage=Sessions.aspx&amp;SessionID=10&amp;SessionDateID=7">recent
session delivered during the CoSN2020 virtual conference</a>,
Girard Kelly gave a preview of what the use of AI could look like by
using an example from his own employer. Kelly works as counsel and
director of the privacy program at nonprofit <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/">Common
Sense Media</a>.
The <a href="https://www.commonsense.org/education/">education
division of Common Sense</a>
serves as a vetting tool to help teachers choose educational software
based on learning ratings, community ratings and privacy ratings.
It's that last category that's especially difficult to nail down,
Kelly said.</p>

<h3>The
Problem with Privacy Policies</h3>
<p>The
problem Common Sense faced was in trying to help teachers and
families make better decisions about the software they use, based on
the privacy policies published by the companies that produce those
programs. The privacy evaluation process is intense and has both
"qualitative and quantitative" aspects. The organization
has to evaluate whether it exists in the first place, whether the
privacy practices are transparent, whether there's advertising or
user tracking in the product, whether the company does data
collection and sells that data, and a whole bunch of other issues.</p>
<p>Common
Sense uses a three-tier rating system: Blue means pass (about 20
percent of products fall into this rating); red means fail (about 10
percent); and orange means proceed with caution (about 70 percent).</p>
<p>The
existence of the privacy rating in itself has already made an impact,
according to Kelly. Of the 750 products already evaluated, about half
of the companies have updated their policies based on the ratings
they've initially been given.</p>
<p>A
big part of the job of developing each rating involves having legal
experts sit for hours and read through the privacy policy posted by
the companies. Many of the policies run "dozens of pages long"
— some 50 to 60 pages — and they're full of legalese, Kelly
noted. "We found that nobody actually reads the privacy policies
because it's really hard and it takes a really long time."</p>
<p>Common
Sense wondered whether machine learning might help speed up the
privacy policy evaluation process by identifying the elements that
were essential in a well-written privacy policy.</p>
<h3>Some
Machine Learning Terms Worth Understanding</h3>
<p>As
Kelly explained, the very concept of AI covers a lot of ground,
encompassing machine learning, knowledge graphs and expert systems.
In the case of ed tech, machine learning dominates by a wide margin.
What distinguishes it from the other flavors of AI is "its
ability to modify itself when exposed to more data." The more
data that's fed into a machine learning model, the more accurate its
recommendations or findings.</p>
<p>Machine
learning itself has subsets too, primarily broken down into how
categorization — the task to be done — takes place.</p>
<p>"Supervised
learning" references the use of prior knowledge of the output.
The model already knows what output is desired, and AI is used to
sort out or classify the input that will lead to that output. Once
the model learns the formula, it can stop learning and do its job.
According to Kelly, supervised learning crops up in identity fraud
detection, image identification and weather forecasting, among other
applications. When you identify the squares in a reCAPTCHA that show
the crosswalk, for instance, you're helping the model learn how to
identify certain imagery in the data.</p>
