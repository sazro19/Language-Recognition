<p>Predictive analytics is growing rapidly in popularity among school district leaders. K-12 school districts are collaborating with universities and businesses (IBM, Dell) at an accelerating pace, using advanced analytics to create innovative new models and tools to advance students' performance. Many school districts across the nation are now using predictive analytics to predict and monitor student performance to improve learning. </p>
<p>School districts use predictive analytics in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>To build early warning indicators based on students' attendance, course failure and behavior to predict dropouts<sup>1, 2</sup>;</li>
<li>To predict on-time high school graduation and being on track in Grade 9<sup>3,4,5</sup>;</li>
<li>To examine indicators that predict college- and career-readiness and postsecondary success<sup>5</sup>; </li>
<li>Recently predictive analytics has also gained momentum in identifying and retaining great teachers<sup>6</sup>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The purpose of this article is to clarify the definition of predictive analytics and describe advantages and limitations of predictive analytics and what school districts need to have to conduct such analysis. (Abundant news articles in recent years show school districts' use of predictive analytics in decision making. These articles typically describe specific uses of results of analytics at a specific system, but they do not discuss or describe the analysis process itself.) In addition, this article will provide some informational resources and examples of how school districts are utilizing predictive analytics results to improve instruction and resource allocation.</p>

<p><strong>What Is Predictive Analytics?<br/>
</strong>Predictive models are mostly regression-based analyses conducted to examine which student-, classroom- and/or school-based indicators empirically predict student outcomes.</p>
<p>The statistical analysis uses a combination of potentially actionable indicators to predict an outcome that needs attention and improvement. Most prediction models tend to use lagging indicators, for example, using Grade 9 indicators to predict the likelihood of on-time graduation from high school; indicators in Grades 8-11 predicting the likelihood of college readiness and immediate college enrollment. </p>
<p>Indicators can include such measurable events as: </p>
<ul>
<li>Course grades; </li>
<li>Attendance; </li>
<li>Course level; </li>
<li>Suspensions; and </li>
<li>Extracurricular involvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>But also less obvious data can be used, such as classroom observations and non-cognitive variables. Analyses provide a predicted score for each individual student so students can be grouped objectively into categories needing high-, medium- or no-intervention to succeed. Predictive analytics cannot say that the indicators caused the outcome but can show what combination of indicators is related to the outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages of Predictive Analytics<br/>
</strong>Indicators are generally data that school staff have significant control over and where conditions in the academic environment can be altered by the school staff. For example, enrollment in rigorous courses or student attendance are indicators that school staff can alter or influence. </p>
<p>Results of analytics assist district and school leaders and staff because those staffers can use data as the basis to inform their decisions. District leaders can use this information to monitor progress of individuals and groups, identify needs and align resources, develop and evaluate intervention programs to assist students and re-allocate resources to address problems and deficiencies more effectively. Change in policy can be based on sound, objective information developed out of analytics. In addition, school staff can use results in designing intervention strategies. Teachers can use these predictive analytics results to improve instructional efforts tailored to individual students. Teachers can have an informed conversation with parents on their child's progress. Teachers can talk to students about individual student's information and assist the student in setting goals.</p>
