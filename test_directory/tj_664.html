<p>One megabit per second per student is the current “magic number” in school network design. It is the long-term goal set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and originally established by the <a href="http://www.setda.org/">State Education Technology Directors Association</a> (SETDA) as the 2017 goal for Internet capacity. It is about the same capacity per user offered in the most basic of cable plans, and an order of magnitude less than what many families need for modern Internet use. This “modern use” includes streaming video, interactive content and fast Web browsing by multiple family members simultaneously. </p>
<p>One megabit per second per student is also a number that only 15 percent of school districts can currently meet, according to CoSN's latest <a href="http://cosn.org/cosns-second-annual-e-rate-and-infrastructure-survey" target="_blank">E-Rate and Infrastructure Survey</a>. In fact, this modest broadband goal is so overwhelming to achieve that many districts cite the financial obstacle as the primary reason they don't embark on a digital transformation for their schools and their students. </p>

<p>Reaching this goal seems outrageously ambitious to many district IT and financial leaders, particularly those in large districts. </p>
<p><strong>Do Schools Really Need That Much Bandwidth?</strong></p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.cosn.org/SEND" target="_blank">CoSN Smart Education Networks by Design</a> (SEND) initiative's work with leading districts, the answer is: absolutely! </p>
<p>School districts can get by for a long time with limited bandwidth and lackluster network design if they are not making the shift to the student-centered teaching and learning enabled by personal devices. But once a district commits to digital transformation, new demands are placed on their technological infrastructure, and those demands begin to grow non-linearly and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The first phenomenon many districts encounter is that no matter how much bandwidth they provide, it's simply not enough. It often takes years for districts to reach a minimal level of capacity where the network itself is no longer the bottleneck for student access to the Internet and their cloud-based resources. Yet as the district adds capacity, student use of their devices explodes to take advantage of the new digital capacity and access to online resources. Often, the district will then take a look at the usage and decide to double the capacity the following year — once again with the same result. Student usage immediately swamps the network capacity. </p>
<p>During the planning process, it may often seem as though there is adequate network capacity, but this is an illusion. Students change their behavior and bandwidth needs surge as the network access allows. This goes on until all the other students try doing the same thing, and new bottlenecks develop. Students then back off their usage and wait until they have better connectivity available to them than at school. Likewise, teachers back off on the kinds of digital work they ask students to do in the classroom, since they don't want to waste instructional minutes on getting everyone logged on a creeping network. The network is used less, and so the capacity levels seem acceptable.</p>
<p>Successful districts monitor their networks carefully in order to determine when they need more capacity. They look at the average bandwidth usage, but also look carefully at peak loads. There are certain times of day — such as when classes start or end and all students are told to log on or off their devices and digital content at the same time — when there is always a spike in demand on the network. </p>
<p>A key question is this: How close does the spike come to 100 percent of the network's capacity? Does it get so high that teachers and students are at risk for backing off their technology usage? In North Carolina, for example, the state education network increases capacity to a district when they find that it exceeds 60 percent capacity more than 85 percent of the time.</p>
