<p><a href="http://www.tabpilot.com/" target="_blank">TabPilot Learning Systems</a> has released <a href="http://www.tabpilot.com/products/" target="_blank">Tablet Manager 4.0</a> with the addition of configuration profiles and other new features.</p>
<p>The configuration profiles "are sets of pre-configured apps, Web-links and other preferences that can be applied by teachers or administrators to groups of tablets," according to a news release. Multiple profiles can be applied for different classes or for different times of day. The company plans to update the management software with the ability to schedule profile changes soon. </p>
<p>Other features new to version 4.0 include the ability to "favorite" apps, an improved menu interface and new permissions settings.</p>
<p>"There has been a lot of focus on one-to-one tablet programs, yet many schools are choosing to use tablets in shared-use settings such as mobile labs or classroom sets,"  said Jarrett Volzer, founder and president of TabPilot, in a prepared statement. "Shared-use settings can present a unique challenge because tablets were primarily designed to be used as personal devices not multi-user devices. While the industry has largely ignored the shared-use implementation scenario, TabPilot has made it a priority to make it function smoothly for both IT staff and teachers. These priorities are evident in TabPilot 4.0, which easily manages one-to-one, shared-use and mixed environments." </p>
