<p> The Consortium for School Networking (CoSN) has released a new guide designed to help school IT leaders prepare for the next disaster that could impact IT systems.</p>
<p> The <a href="https://cosn.org/sites/default/files/IT%20Crisis%20Preparedness%20Countdown%202019.pdf">IT Crisis Preparedness Countdown</a> includes actions schools should take during emergencies, as well as general steps IT leaders can take to prepare for crises and important steps to take after, “from collecting, assessing and reporting information to tracking the status of equipment and operating systems.”</p>
<p> “We urge all districts, regardless of location, to prepare for IT catastrophes — many of which are caused by Mother Nature with short notice. School systems should develop an IT continuity plan that is part of their larger emergency operations strategy. This will help school leaders assess any IT damage, provide stakeholders with status updates, bring critical systems back online and resume operations ASAP,” said Keith Krueger, CEO of CoSN, in a prepared statement.</p>
