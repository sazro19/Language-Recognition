<p>The Colorado Convention Center in Denver is hosting this year's ISTE conference, June 26–29. <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/gallery-1059122p1.html?cr=00&amp;pl=edit-00">Arina P Habich</a> / <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/editorial?cr=00&amp;pl=edit-00">Shutterstock.com</a></p>

<p>The term "keynote" comes from music and designates  the note or tone on which the set of tones is founded. It forms the basis of a  music composition. Eventually, that definition evolved to mean the main idea or  central principle of a speech. Now we simply use it to denote the speakers at  an event that everybody in attendance is supposed to listen to. But the modern  meaning doesn't do justice to this year's <a href="https://conference.iste.org/2016/" target="_blank">ISTE 2016</a> keynoters, who will,  indeed, set a tone for what else is planned to take place during the event in  Denver, officially starting Sunday, June 26.</p>

<p><strong>Sunday with Dr. Kaku<br/>
</strong>On Sunday evening, futurist and physicist <a href="https://conference.iste.org/2016/program/search_session_detail.php?id=101065707" target="_blank">Michio  Kaku</a> ends the first day of the event by examining the technologies that  peek inside the human brain. Kaku is an interesting choice to kick off an  annual conference for the <a href="https://conference.iste.org/2016/" target="_blank">International Society for Technology in Education</a>. After  all, he's the author and television personality who, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fphPeRvhjQ&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">a panel  discussion</a> in January, stated that the "United States has the worst  education system known to science," noting that "our graduates  compete regularly at the level of third-world countries."</p>

<p>Why doesn't the STEM establishment collapse as a result, you  might ask? In the same panel Kaku pointed to "America's secret  weapon" — the H-1B visa, which allows U.S. companies to employ foreign  workers in specialized jobs temporarily. Without the H-1B program, he declared,  "the scientific establishment of this country would collapse. Forget about  Google. Forget about Silicon Valley. There would be no Silicon Valley."</p>
<p><em>THE Journal</em> will  be tuning in to Kaku's ISTE keynote to find out whether he makes any  recommendations for improving education in this country —besides continuing to  import talent for the jobs of the future.</p>
<p>If you'd like to meet Kaku in person, those willing to  attend the keynote at an onsite "satellite location" will get the  chance to have their books signed by the futurist and receive a  behind-the-scenes virtual tour, delivered by ISTE chair elect Mila Thomas  Fuller. <a href="https://conference.iste.org/2016/?id=104893398" target="_blank">Pre-registration  is required</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday with Dr. Ruha  Benjamin<br/>
</strong>Ruha Benjamin is a faculty member in the <a href="http://aas.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Department of African American Studies at  Princeton University</a>. But that description minimizes the disciplines her  research crosses: science, medicine, and biotechnology; race-ethnicity and  gender; and biopolitics and the sociology of knowledge.</p>
