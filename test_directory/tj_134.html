<p>A company best known for its 1990s-era audio streaming  software has just made a new facial recognition application available free to  schools in the United States and Canada. <a href="https://www.realnetworks.com/" target="_blank">RealNetworks</a>,  which now produces games, media management applications and mobile phone  technology, recently introduced <a href="https://safr.com/k12/" target="_blank">SAFR</a>, a  program for detecting and matching faces in real time. The goal of making the  system free, said Chairman and CEO Rob Glaser, is to  "make schools safer."</p>
<p>SAFR requires the presence of one or two IP video cameras,  access to the SAFR recognition software and SAFR application, which run on the  iMac Pro or Mac Pro with macOS Sierra 10.12+, and the SAFR iPad app. Support  for Windows, Linux and Android are "coming soon," RealNetworks noted  on its website.</p>
<p>According to the company, its software can recognize faces  at varying degrees and distances from the camera, in myriad poses, that are  partially obscured, that have different expressions, that are heavily made up  or that are captured in extreme lighting conditions.</p>

<p>The system was tested this summer at <a href="http://www.ucds.org/" target="_blank">University Child Development School</a>, a private school  in Seattle, located a few miles from RealNetworks' headquarters. "SAFR  immediately proved to be an enormously valuable asset, helping to ensure that  our open, urban campus stays secure," said Paula Smith, head of school.  "The facial recognition solution provides parents and staff faster campus  and building access, freeing up staff so they can devote more time to student  needs."</p>

<p>In the face of <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2018/07/17/schools-face-civil-liberties-battles-in-effort-to-adopt-facial-recognition.aspx" target="_blank">public  concerns regarding the use of facial recognition</a> in schools, the company emphasized  the privacy aspects of its technology, stating that the program encrypts its  facial data and images and never transmits that data when the system is used  locally.</p>
<p>RealNetworks has put the software through its paces, testing  it against a University of Massachusetts benchmark for accuracy, where it  scored 99.8 percent for "<a href="http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/" target="_blank">labeled  faces in the wild</a>." The company also submitted the program to the  National Institute of Standards and Technology <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt-ongoing" target="_blank">"face  recognition vendor test"</a>, where it ranked 18th in a leaderboard for  top performing algorithms measured on false non-match rate across several  different datasets.</p>
<p>RealNetworks reported that it would be introducing  additional versions of SAFR for commercial use in the fall.</p>
