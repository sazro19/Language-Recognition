<p>A nonprofit organization of parents who advocate for school choice in North Carolina has released a web application to help families in the state easily find education data on schools in their area. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://pefnc.org/" target="_blank">Parents for Educational Freedom in North Carolina</a> (PEFNC) created the <a href="http://www.ncschoolsaroundme.com/" target="_blank">NC Schools Around Me</a> web app after receiving more than 35,000 requests for information on educational options in the state, according to a news release. To use the online tool, parents can input their home address to create a map of school options and receive the latest report card data from <a href="http://stateboard.ncpublicschools.gov/" target="_blank">NC State Board of Education</a>’s <a href="http://www.dpi.state.nc.us/src/" target="_blank">Department of Public Instruction</a>. </p>
<p>"As an organization of over 60,000 parental school choice supporters as well as hundreds of choice schools in our state, our office is often inundated with requests from families across our state who are seeking the right educational options for their children,” said Allison Guenther, state outreach director of PEFNC, in a statement. "With NC Schools Around Me, our team can now direct them to this resource, as a start down this educational journey for their children. We worked hard to ensure our state-of-the-art web app is user-friendly, fast and easy for any parent to navigate.”</p>

<p>The web app offers data on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>2,445 public schools;</li>
<li>167 public charter schools; and</li>
<li>Nearly half (431 out of 700) of private schools enrolled in PEFNC’s <a href="http://pefnc.org/nc-opportunity-scholarship/" target="_blank">Opportunity Scholarship Program</a> and <a href="http://pefnc.org/legislation/disabilities-scholarships/" target="_blank">Children with Disability Scholarship Program</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>"In light of the significant growth of school choice in our state (public charter schools and private school scholarships), it is critical for families in North Carolina to have a way to properly navigate these array of options so that they make the best decision for their children educationally,” said Darrell Allison, founding president of PEFNC, in a statement.</p>
