<p>A company  that specializes in desktop virtualization has released an edition of its  technology specifically to work with <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/academic/compare-office-365-education-plans" target="_blank">Microsoft Office 365 Education  Edition</a>. <a href="https://www.neverware.com/office365#office365title" target="_blank">CloudReady</a>, which <a href="https://www.neverware.com/#introtext-3" target="_blank">Neverware</a> developed in partnership with  Microsoft, is intended to help districts run newer software and services on older  machines, thereby extending their usage lives.</p>
<p>When  installed on a school's devices, including older PCs and Macs released over the  last decade, CloudReady enables IT administrators to manage the hardware and  online versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and other applications. In  essence, the software converts the machine into a device that's similar to a  Chromebook.</p>
<p>In 2015 Neverware  launched the CloudReady operating system, which integrated with <a href="https://edu.google.com/products/productivity-tools/classroom/index.html" target="_blank">Google's suite of education apps</a> and works with <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/182076?hl=en" target="_blank">Google's G Suite Administrator</a> console. According to the company,  the price for the program is $1 per student per school year, including support,  when the entire district is enrolled. An annual per-device license is $15; a  perpetual per-device license is $59.</p>
