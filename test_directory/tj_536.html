<p>The <a href="http://www.wallerisd.net/" target="_blank">Waller Independent  School District</a> has adopted a new tool to automate management of student  and employee accounts.</p>
<p>"IT staff at the district had been manually managing  accounts for more than 6,900 students and 900 staff members, which was an  extremely time-consuming process that lead to a large amount of pollution on  the network," according to a news release. "The district decided they  needed a way to automate most of their basic account management functions so  that the IT department didn't need to spend days creating, changing, and  disabling accounts, while also setting a standard for naming accounts."</p>
<p>Waller ISD decided to adopt <a href="https://www.tools4ever.com/" target="_blank">Tools4Ever's</a> <a href="https://www.tools4ever.com/software/user-management-resource-administrator/" target="_blank">User  Management Resource Administrator</a> (URMA), which allows district personnel  to easily add new students to the Skyward student information system and  automatically create an account in Active Directory. The process follows  district guidelines for assigning access privileges, campus containers and  groups and sends an e-mail to the relevant individuals any time a user account  is altered.</p>

<p>"With UMRA in place the district no longer needs to  worry about spending time adding, changing and removing student and staff  accounts anymore," said Rosa Ojeda, technology director at Waller ISD, in  a prepared statement. "Tools4ever has been great to work with. They are  always onboard to help us with problems, concerns, changes or situations. I don't  really see Tools4ever as a standard vendor, but more as a partner."</p>
