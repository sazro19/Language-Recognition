The district’s <strong>Piedmont High</strong> was named one of “America’s Best High Schools” by <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> as well as “Apple Distinguished School,” and a Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education. Akin may be best known for using federal funding to make the entire town wireless as a way to increase equity for Piedmont students, about half of whom did not have Internet access at home. </p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal</em></strong><strong>: What’s been the driving factor behind your technology strategy for the district?</strong><br/>
<strong>Matt Akin</strong>: Well, we were once a big textile town, and as in a lot of other communities in the South, in the last couple of decades all of our industry has left. Five years ago, our board and I realized that if the school district didn’t become the catalyst for change, our community might not be here. It was at that point that we looked at how we could educate kids differently to give them the same opportunities they would receive if they lived in the suburbs or a big city … and how we could do that in an environment where we don’t have a lot of teachers and our curriculum is limited. </p>

<p><strong><em>THE Journal</em></strong><strong>: How did you go about using technology to increase access?</strong><br/>
<strong>Akin</strong>: We began with a federal grant that enabled us to obtain laptops at the high school. We then built on that with local funds, and five years ago we started a 1-to-1 initiative for our kids in fourth through 12th grades, putting <a href="file://localhost/macbook-air">MacBook Airs</a> in everyone’s hands 24/7. We’re not an affluent community, so we really had to prioritize our local funds to make it happen. </p>
<p>We quickly realized, though, that even when all of our kids had computers, once they left the school grounds things weren’t equal. One night in December, I was working late, and as I left school I thought, “What’s that on the front porch of our middle school?” It was the glow from a MacBook, with kids sitting around it pulling off of our wireless at school.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal</em></strong><strong>: How did you end up making the entire town wireless after that?</strong><br/>
<strong>Akin</strong>: We were one of 19 school districts chosen to participate in an E-rate program pilot project. Others used their funding to give a device to every kid; since we already had the devices, we hired a vendor to build a network over our city and then used the funds to lease Internet access from that vendor. This ensured that wherever our students went, they could pull up lessons and instructional resources. It changed everything for us. Our teachers could truly do flipped instruction and require projects that needed Internet access to complete. We had been saying, “Whatever your kid needs he can download before he leaves school,” but that’s just not possible. </p>
<p>When the pilot program ended, we worked out a funding agreement with the city and the vendor to keep it going, because people would probably run me out of town if we took it away now.</p>

<h3>Matt Akin's Top 3 Strategies for Using Tech in Rural Schools</h3>
<p>Access is vital: “To truly utilize technology to personalize learning, students must have 24/7 access to devices and the Internet.”</p>
<p>Break the mold: “Provide an ‘innovation safe’ environment for teachers and administrators to take risks with instructional techniques.”</p>
<p>It’s all about the teachers: “Effectively teaching in a digital environment is not easy, so my No. 1 goal is to support our teachers in
the effort.”</p>
