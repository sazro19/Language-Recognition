<p><a href="http://www.innovationhs.org/" target="_blank">Renaissance Charter High School for Innovation</a> in New York City has replaced
its home-grown information system with a consolidated student information and
financial system.</p>
<p>The public-charter high school serving East Harlem needed to reduce costs and
improve the efficiency of its information system, which took weeks to generate a
typical demographic report. The school considered hiring three to four new staff
members at a cost of about $150,000 per year to help maintain and operate the
old system, but a review of K-12 technology systems on the market revealed a
more cost-effective solution.</p>
<p>The school implemented the <a href="http://www.ptsteams.com/products.php" target="_blank">Total Education Administrative Management Solution</a> (TEAMS) from Prologic Technology Solutions to provide a consolidated student
information and financial system. "TEAMS was the logical choice for us," said
Dru Collins, vice principal of the school, in a prepared statement. "It is very
robust, yet very easy to use."</p>

<p>The TEAMS student information system (SIS) supports enrollment, gradebooks,
attendance, reporting by teacher level, assignments, transfers and transcripts,
and the financial system integrates with human resource information and payroll.
According to the company, it provides "an end-to-end linkage of employee and
student data for a single campus or an entire district."</p>
<p>Since implementing the system, the school has reduced the amount of time
required to run demographic reports from weeks to 30 minutes, and the school no
longer needs to hire additional staff to maintain and operate the system.</p>
