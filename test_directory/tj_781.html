<p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a> has launched a free new <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/khan-academy/id469863705" target="_blank">iPad app</a> featuring interactive exercises, handwriting recognition and more.</p>
<p>Features of the app include:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 150,000 interactive exercises aligned  to the Common Core featuring instant feedback and step-by-step hints;</li>
<li>Exercise recommendations that adjust to the  student in an effort to provide appropriate practice that is neither too hard  nor too easy;</li>
<li>A scratchpad that allows students to show their  work and recognizes handwritten answers to problems;</li>
<li>Track back, which syncs progress between the app  and khanacademy.org; and</li>
<li>Videos and articles covering topics such as arithmetic, pre-algebra, algebra, geometry, trigonometry,  statistics, calculus, linear algebra, biology, chemistry, physics, economics, art  history, civics finance and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Launching  our iPad app is an important step toward meeting learners where they're at on the  platforms they're using most," said Khan Academy Product Manager <span itemprop="name">Matt Wahl</span>, in a prepared statement. "We took  lots of time to consider crafting the best possible experience on the iPad,  including highly interactive content, expansive handwriting recognition and a  design that puts our best content at finger's reach. After working with many  learners to understand and hone the experience, we're excited about the role  this can play in learning for students around the world."</p>
