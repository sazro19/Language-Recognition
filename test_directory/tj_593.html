<p>Education IT leaders still consider affordability the main  obstacle to securing "robust connectivity" for their schools. That's  been true for at least three years running. Nearly half (46 percent) cite the  cost of recurring expenses as the biggest barrier; a solid third (34 percent)  reference upfront expenses as a major problem. Almost a fifth (19 percent) pay  $50 per megabit per second or more per month for their Internet connection. While  that's down from 32 percent in 2014, it's still painful compared to the 36  percent of school districts that pay less than $5 per Mbps in 2015.</p>
<p>These results surfaced in the third annual "<a href="http://cosn.org/download-our-3rd-annual-infrastructure-survey" target="_blank">Consortium  for School Networking (CoSN) Infrastructure Survey</a>." <a href="http://cosn.org/" target="_blank">CoSN</a> worked with <a href="http://www.aasa.org/" target="_blank">AASA,  The School Superintendents Association</a>, and marketing firm MDR to collect  data from K-12 school leaders and technology directors nationwide. Responses  were collected from 531 people in 48 states, representing urban, rural and  suburban school systems, large, medium and small.</p>

<p>Nearly half of respondents (46 percent) reported that only  one Internet provider delivered Internet service to school systems in their  areas. In rural areas the lack of competition was even more pronounced — 54  percent reported just a single Internet provider. Not only does that affect  affordability, CoSN researchers noted, it also decreases the ability for IT  organizations to provide for network redundancy, which they consider a best  practice.</p>
<p>The second big area of frustration is the lack of truly  ample broadband capacity. CoSN references speeds first put forth by the <a href="http://www.setda.org/" target="_blank">State Education Technology Directors Association</a> (SETDA) and later adopted by the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/" target="_blank">Federal  Communications Commission</a>, which defined sufficient short-term bandwidth as  100 Mbps per 1,000 students; the long-term goal is 1 Gbps per 1,000 students.</p>
<p>According  to the survey, 23 percent of respondents have Internet bandwidth speeds of 10  Mbps or less for 1,000 students — just a tenth of that short-term goal. The  same number of school systems said none of the schools in their districts could  meet the short-term broadband goal. Sixty-six percent of respondents reported  that their school system reached the short-term goal; 10 percent have reached  the long-term goal.</p>
<p>The picture for off-campus connectivity reveals an area of  struggle too. Three quarters of school leaders said they have no strategies for  providing connectivity to students at home or after school. As the report  noted, this lack of digital equity presents a "critical problem": "Students  who lack Internet access service outside of the traditional school day cannot  maximize learning opportunities in a digital environment."</p>
<p>Other findings of the survey include these:</p>
<ul>
<li>School wireless networks lag: One in three  districts said they still don't use current wireless industry standards (such  as 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac);</li>
<li>Reliability isn't guaranteed. A quarter of  districts reported "unplanned Internet downtime" for at least three  days during the year;</li>
<li>Lit fiber is becoming the Internet transport  mechanism of choice. More than 7 in 10 respondents said they're using lit fiber  for WAN operations, an uptick from 46 percent last year. What this means, the  report's authors stated, is that "many more schools have the capacity to  provide broadband speeds to the school door"; and</li>
<li>APs are getting faster. More than 60 percent of  school districts have typical a connection speed of 1 Gbps access.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Education is going digital. Yet school system  technology leaders face many challenges as they plan their education networks  for the future," said CoSN CEO Keith Krueger. "While progress is  happening, policymakers and educators will need to keep their eyes focused on  continued investments in robust, reliable education networks with broadband  access and Wi-Fi to enable digital learning and address issues of digital  equity."</p>
