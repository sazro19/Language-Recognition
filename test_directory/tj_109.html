<p>Education is among one of the top verticals affected by a  newer form of nefarious cybercrime. Malicious cryptomining or cryptojacking, as  it's called, describes the theft of computer processing resources  —   electricity, cloud services and other digital assets —  that are then exploited  to do cryptocurrency mining without the owner's permission or knowledge,  according to a recent report by Cisco.</p>
<p>According to the company, unauthorized cryptomining activity  grew 19 times, increasing from 600,000 queries in March to 11.3 million by  December. The impact is felt by its victim companies through degraded  performance, systems attacks and higher electricity usage, as well as possible  compliance problems, particularly in the area of security exchange regulations.</p>
<p>While the largest target was made up of energy and utility  companies, in the Cisco study, colleges experienced 22 percent of all  cryptomining attempts, while K-12 made up 4 percent of the total. Cisco,  which sells <a href="https://umbrella.cisco.com/" target="_blank">Umbrella</a>,  an enterprise cloud security service intended to stop users from connecting to  malicious sites, said those organizations with fewer than 10,000 employees were  the primary focus, making up eight in 10 of the targets hit by cryptomining  traffic.</p>
