<p>As part of a broad expansion of its public sector efforts, <a href="https://www.vmware.com/" target="_blank">VMware</a> reported it's beefing up its education offerings, with a particular emphasis on  security to support online high-stakes assessments for K-12 within  its virtualization and cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>The company previously announced that its VMware Horizon View had been <a href="http://www.testnavqualified.com/" target="_blank">qualified to support the Pearson TestNav</a> online test delivery system. </p>
<p>Now VMware is releasing an <a href="http://info.vmware.com/content/22590_education_online_testing_index" target="_blank">updated secure online testing solution</a> designed to "[make] it easy for school districts to deliver state mandated online testing that complies with the Common Core State Standards Initiative with minimal IT resources and disruption." The company is currently seeking certification from the American Institutes for Research to deliver their online assessments as well.</p>
<p>Horizon View, built on VMware vSphere, is designed to simplify IT management of end user devices by transforming "traditional physical PCs into centrally managed IT services and delivers elastic desktop services as a virtual workspace for ultimate control and flexibility for user experience, administration and service." The company said Horizon View has been deployed broadly in education at all levels throughout the United States. The video case study below shows how one Texas school district is using the system to deliver secure online tests.</p>
