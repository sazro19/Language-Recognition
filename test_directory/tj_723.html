<p><a href="http://press4kids.com/" target="_blank">News-O-Matic</a>, billed as a daily newspaper just for kids, has partnered with <a href="https://www.metametricsinc.com/" target="_blank">MetaMetrics</a> to add <a href="https://www.lexile.com/" target="_blank">Lexile</a> scores to its resources in an effort to help teachers provide grade-appropriate nonfiction text and differentiated instruction.</p>
<p>News-O-Matic features five daily stories, each reviewed by an on-staff psychologist to ensure safety, covering national and international news, sports, arts, science and more. The app is designed to encourage students to engage with the stories through drawings, writing, voting for their favorite articles and asking interview questions of politicians, athletes and others.</p>
<p>Most News-O-Matic stories receive Lexile measures between 400L and 1,000L and "teachers can easily adjust the students' reading levels so they can all enjoy the same rich multimedia experience but tailored to their unique abilities," according to a news release. </p>
<p>Other features of News-O-Matic include:</p>
