<p><a href="https://www.instructure.com/" target="_blank">Instructure</a> today revealed a new partnership with <a href="https://www.cerego.com/" target="_blank">Cerego</a>, bringing the latter’s advanced personalized learning platform to the <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/" target="_blank">Canvas</a> learning management system (LMS).</p>
<p>Cerego is now available for integration in Canvas, according to a news release, enabling users to take advantage of the company’s course-complete adaptive courseware (which faculty can customize if needed), along with analytics dashboards for instructors and students.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cerego.com/technology" target="_blank">Cerego technology</a> uses a proprietary and evidence-supported algorithm to assess individual memory strength based on a learner’s performance, the forgetting curve and distributed practice formulas. Using these factors, the platform develops an error-correcting model and delivers an optimal schedule for the learner. </p>
