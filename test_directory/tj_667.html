</ul>
<p>With its third upgrade since <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2014/10/21/netop-debuts-classroom-workflow-app-for-ipads.aspx%20" target="_blank">introducing
the Vision ME iPad
classroom workflow app</a> last October, <a href="https://www.netop.com/" target="_blank">Netop</a>
is now offering teachers an improved
student enrollment process and both teachers and students the ability to
use
more file formats. At the same time, it added Japanese to the list of
five
languages it is available in.</p>
<p>The latest version of <a href="https://www.netop.com/visionme" target="_blank">Vision
ME</a> means teachers and students
can now present, share and view file formats of all versions of
Microsoft Word,
Excel, PowerPoint, iWorks and a variety of video formats.</p>
<p>"We've made it easier than ever for teachers to share
many
different file types with students in real time," said Netop CEO Kurt
Bager. "It's
an immediate way to engage students more deeply in classroom
instruction."</p>
<p>The new version also makes it easier for teachers to
quickly
invite new students to create accounts or join classes.</p>

<br/>
<p>Introduced last fall, the Vision ME made it possible
for
teachers to present lessons directly on classroom iPads, showcase
student work,
blank student screens, block Internet access and administer Web-based
tests and
quizzes.</p>
<p>It could also help teachers to distribute and collect
assignments, broadcast messages and chat with students, both
individually and
in groups.</p>
<p>In January, Netop's <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2015/01/06/app-enhancement-gives-teachers-more-control-in-ipad-classrooms.aspx%20" target="_blank">enhancements
of Vision ME</a> included the
ability for students to make presentations to the rest of the class from
their
own iPads and to share files with both their classmates and those
outside the
classroom.</p>
<p>In February, <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2015/02/19/classroom-management-app-now-available-in-multiple-languages.aspx%20" target="_blank">a
new version of the app was introduced</a> that was
available in Spanish, French, Dutch and German, as well as English. By
changing
an iOS language setting, teachers could use multiple languages and
accommodate
classes with students who spoke different languages.</p>
<p>The Vision ME apps are available for $7.50 per user
with
volume discounts, preceded by a free 30-day trial period.</p>
