<p>A
        team of researchers at universities in Florida and the Netherlands may
        have
        developed a new kind of optical fiber that can transmit data at more
        than 20
        times  current top  speeds.</p>
<p>An
article
        published recently in the online publication <a href="www.nature.com/nphoton" target="_blank">Nature
          Photonics</a> describes
        research done by a team of scientists from the <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en" target="_blank">Eindhoven
          University of
          Technology</a> in Eindhoven, Netherlands and the <a href="www.ucf.edu" target="_blank">University
          of Central Florida</a> in
        Orlando, FL that could lead to a solution to the impending challenge of
        increasing bandwidth demand throughout the world.</p>
<p>Most
research
        in this area has involved increasing the power of signals
        delivered
        over optical glass fibers enough to overcome the losses created by the
        glass
        the fibers are manufactured with. However, the team from the two
        universities
        may have demonstrated the potential of a new type of fiber that could
        mitigate
        the impending “capacity crunch.”</p>

<p>The
team,
        led by Chigo Okonkwo, an assistant professor of electro-optical
        communications at Eindhoven, and Rodrigo Amezcua Correa, a research
        assistant
        professor in micro-structured fibers at Central Florida, said in the
        Nature
        Photonics article that they have demonstrated the transmission of data
        at 255
        terabytes per second.</p>
<p>The
new
        type of fiber the team is experimenting with has seven different cores
        that
        light can travel through, instead of the one core that most current
        state-of-the-art fiber has. The researchers compare it to going from a
        one-way
        road to a seven-lane highway. At the same time, they are introducing
        orthogonal
        dimensions to data transmission – the equivalent of three cars driving
        on top
        of each other in the same lane.</p>
<p>Okonkwo
from
        Eindhoven said, “At less than 200 microns in diameter, this fiber does
        not
        take noticeably more space than conventional fibers already deployed.”</p>
