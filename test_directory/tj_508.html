<p>The <a href="http://www.maine.gov/doe/" target="_blank">Maine Department of  Education</a> has selected a partner to provide a state level student  information and reporting system (SSIRS).</p>
<p>Following a competitive bidding process, the department  chose the <a href="http://www.edupoint.com/Products/Student-Information-Management" target="_blank">Synergy  Education Platform</a> from <a href="http://www.edupoint.com/" target="_blank">Edupoint  Educational Systems</a> "to aggregate data from all school  administrative units (SAUs), using Ed-Fi to collect data on Maine's 180,000  students for state and federal reporting mandated by the state's Department of  Education," according to a news release.</p>
<p>The solution will offer a central database connecting SAUs  with the state's student data collection process in an effort to improve  reporting functionality and the quality and access of student data. Districts  without a local data system will be able to input data to the platform using  any supported browser. "Student demographics, enrollment, health,  assessment, CTE and special education data will be submitted by SAUs through  the securely hosted Synergy State solution, where query and reporting tools  will allow the state to access, display, and analyze data in real time,"  according to a news release.</p>

<p>As a result of the partnership, SAUs will also be able to  license the synergy platform at pre-negotiated rates and without a bid process.</p>
<p>"Maine's student data represents one of the cornerstones  for the Department of Education as we try to make informed decisions on improving  educational results," said Brian Snow Maine's education data manager, in a  prepared statement. "The Synergy product promises better control of the  quality of information collected, which can then ensure better decisions."</p>
