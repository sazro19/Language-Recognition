<p>The <a href="http://sungardk12.com/student-information-system/" target="_blank">eSchoolPLUS</a> student information system is integrating with the <a href="https://www.schoology.com/home.php" target="_blank">Schoology</a> LMS, enabling a direct exchange of data from both software systems.</p>
<p>The partnership is designed to provide teachers with a single tool to manage their classrooms by offering both LIS and SIS features. With it, teachers can track attendance, intervention management, and engagement with learning materials as well as store files and run virtual classrooms.  </p>
<p>In a statement, Joel Hames, the director of product management at SunGard K12 Education, the company that owns eSchoolPLUS, said the alliance will create a seamless integration between the two software systems. “Now when data is recorded, updated, or deleted, those changes flow automatically between the two solutions, saving time and effort associated with manual transfers and helping ensure accuracy of information in both systems,” he said.</p>
