<p>A private school in Fort Worth, TX with 167 students in  grades preK-8 has adopted a new Internet management tool to keep students on  task. <a href="http://www.ascsfw.org/" target="_blank">All Saints Catholic  School</a> chose <a href="https://www.net-ref.com/" target="_blank">NetRef</a> from a company  with the same name to enable its teachers to set Internet access boundaries in  their classrooms.</p>
<p>All Saints, which runs a dual-language program in English  and Spanish and maintains a computer lab, also is increasingly using tablets in  its classrooms. NetRef helps the educators manage student Internet usage via a  touch-screen panel. Teachers can program allowable domains and applications  that are relevant to the lesson and receive real-time alerts when a student  wanders off-task.</p>
<p>"At All Saints, we are committed to imbuing our  students with the linguistic and technological skills as well as a  multicultural, compassionate worldview that will best prepare them for the  future," said Principal <a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ascsfw.org%2Ffaculty-staff&amp;esheet=51309064&amp;newsitemid=20160329006277&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Arica+Prado&amp;index=7&amp;md5=67278a6baa58291a7960de6622564f7f" target="_blank">Arica Prado</a> in a prepared statement. "Technology helps  foster language skills, so it plays a critical role in our intensive bilingual  curriculum and culture. Our new investment in NetRef will help our teachers and  students maximize the Web as an educational and collaborative learning  tool."</p>
