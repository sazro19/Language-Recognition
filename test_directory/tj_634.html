In the fall of 2009, the division began a two-year process of implementing a desktop virtualization initiative to enhance mobility for students and teachers — and, as an added benefit, to pave the way for BYOD as an alternative to 1-to-1.

<p><strong>My Top 3 Tech Trends that Prepare Students for College or the Workforce</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Access to networks</strong>: Students will always be connected, and with that connectivity comes responsibility. The way connectivity is used for social or entertainment purposes is different from the way connectivity is used for work, whether school or career. There is a place and time for everything, and just because you can connect with friends 24/7 doesn’t mean you should.</p>
<p><strong>Access to devices</strong>: Students have a variety of devices at their disposal for various purposes: from a quick Web lookup, reading email, keeping schedules/calendars and taking photographs, to research, preparing complex email messages and running minor business apps, to composing complex documents/spreadsheets/presentations or running production business applications. Stop calling BYOD an initiative. It is no more of an initiative than paper and pencil is an initiative.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Access to applications:</strong> The mission-critical applications used by schools and employers are available all of the time and on any device. No longer will a Windows environment be limited to a Windows computer. Students will move seamlessly between locally installed apps on iPads, iPhones, Android devices, etc., to hosted applications and/or virtual Windows desktops — whatever is the right tool to get work done. </p>

<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em></strong><strong> What led you to decide to go in this direction?</strong><br/>
<strong>Douglas Meade:</strong> Around 2008 we were hearing complaints from teachers that were legitimate, and what they boiled down to was: We want access to our stuff. They weren't using that language, but that was what they were saying. Every classroom had something called an I-station that was hooked up to the LCD projector in the ceiling. It had a VCR, a document camera, an “ink link” where they could write something that showed up on the screen and save it, and they could walk into the classroom and put their notebook computer on that docking station that was connected to all of these devices and the projector. They could teach, take the computer off the docking station and take it home with them. However, for security purposes we didn’t allow them to connect to an outside network. You couldn't just randomly install software on it because we'd end up with viruses or software conflicts and corruptions. So they could just use it in a standalone mode away from school with whatever it was that was installed on it. Teachers were complaining that they wanted to be able to do more on this notebook computer. What they really wanted was access — to be able to work at home just like they could work at school. We had had our finger on the pulse of some of the early virtualized desktops for quite some time, so we started looking more closely to see if that technology had gotten to where we thought it needed to be to serve the classroom. </p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em></strong><strong> What were your concerns?</strong><br/>
<strong>Meade:</strong> The two biggest were first, would it stream video well, because streaming video is something that is a necessity in K-12; and second, there are a lot of instructional applications that are not well written, and trying to get those to work virtualized, streamed or hosted was a bit of a challenge. But we looked at it and decided that the Citrix HDX technology had gotten to where it needed to be. And that became a game-changer for us.</p>
