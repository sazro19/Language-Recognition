<p>The bootcamps will be taking place at various Miami-Dade County high schools, including <a href="http://miaminorlandshs.org/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Miami Norland Senior High School</a>, <a href="http://homesteadshs.com/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Homestead Senior High School</a> and <a href="http://sdshs.net/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">South Dade Senior High School</a>, as well as <a href="http://robertmorganeducenter.com/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Robert Morgan Technical College</a>. Miami-Dade County residents or students attending a school in the district are eligible to apply; about 400 youth will be selected through a lottery system for two cohorts (June 19-July 28 and June 26-August 4).</p>
<p>Leading the effort, CSSF is a public-private partnership that uses state and federal funding to develop workforce and training policies. TechLaunch @ FVI is an information technology (IT) coding bootcamp, run by the Florida-based <a href="http://www.techlaunch.com/" target="_blank">TechLaunch</a> business accelerator, that works to get individuals in new careers in under a year.</p>
<p>The larger vision for the Tech Hire Summer Bootcamps initiative is to build a pipeline of local talent and prepare the next-generation workforce for careers in tech by equipping them with industry skills. The program is aligned with former President Barack Obama’s <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/node/325231" target="_blank">TechHire</a> initiative, a multi-sector initiative launched in 2015 to empower students to enter IT careers.</p>
