<p>Colorado's <a href="http://www.ffc8.org/" target="_blank">Fountain-Fort Carson School District 8</a> has deployed a fiber optic wide area
network (WAN) connecting 15 facilities and offering speeds capable of 10 Gigabits per second or more.</p>
<p>"The vision of Fountain-Fort Carson School District 8 is to prepare students, preschool to post secondary, with the most advanced math,
science, technology and life-skills taught by the highest quality staff," said Cheryl Serrano, superintendent of the district, in a prepared
statement. "We know our new fiber-optic network will allow us to further educate our children in a technology driven world, ultimately helping
us achieve our vison for all students."</p>
<p>The network was paid in part through E-rate funding and built by <a href="http://uniteprivatenetworks.com/" target="_blank">Unite Private
Networks</a>.</p>
<p>"Unite Private Networks offers an optimal design that utilizes, at a minimum, a one Gigabit connection to all facilities via home run fiber
from every location back to the hub site," said Randy Wright, director of education sales at Unite Private Networks, in a prepared statement.
"There is no sharing of bandwidth and no network congestion among district locations. Our state-of-the-art solution allows the district
dedicated bandwidth and unlimited future growth potential."</p>
