<p>The new app features "a year's worth of math skills"  aligned to content for students in grades K-2, according to information  released by HMH, and more than 1,500 problems covering topics such as addition,  subtraction, measuring, graphs, charts, geometry, money, time and fractions.</p>
<p>"Go Math! Go also provides feedback as children  play, helping them solve math problems in accessible steps, and offers  encouragement and rewards to help build confidence and prepare young learners for  more complex math knowledge," according to a news release. "In  addition to learning math skills, children will build a foundation in other  areas essential for healthy development and success in school and beyond, such  as self-regulation, following directions, perseverance and working memory."</p>
