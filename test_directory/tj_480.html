<p>“Early back-to-school promotions are building interest and momentum for the second-largest shopping event of the year,” said Steve Koenig, senior director of market research at CTA, in a prepared statement. “Deals on the tech items for back-to-school including 2-in-1 [detachable] laptops, Bluetooth speakers, headphones, tablets and more are creating excitement among consumers. This consumer enthusiasm also bodes well for tech sales across the second half of the year.”
</p>
<p>About half of back-to-school shoppers (49 percent) plan to shop at an online retailer, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Online only retailer’s website (80 percent)
    </li>
<li>
    Retailer’s website (69 percent)
    </li>
<li>
    Auction website (35 percent)
    </li>
<li>
    Manufacturer’s website (30 percent)
    </li>
<li>Free classified ad website (13 percent)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most back-to-school shopping occurs in the month of August (60 percent, according to CTA), and a large majority of consumers will begin back-to-school shopping either one month before school starts (41 percent) or one to four weeks before school starts (40 percent).</p>
<p>Overall, adoption of the so-called Internet of Things and enthusiasm for emerging tech will drive the U.S. consumer technology industry to $296.6 billion in retail revenues in 2016, according to CTA’s <a href="https://www.cta.tech/Research-Standards/Reports-Studies/Studies/2016/U-S-Consumer-Technology-Sales-and-Forecasts-%28July.aspx" target="_blank">“U.S. Consumer Technology Sales and Forecasts,”</a> a semi-annual report that forecasts 300-plus product categories, including back-to-school staples such as detachable laptops, tablets, smartphones, headphones, Bluetooth speakers and more.</p>
