<p>An education organization working to instill project learning into K–12 and higher education has teamed up with an organization of professional project managers to help high schools extend their work in project-based learning (PBL) and project management. </p>
<p>The<a href="http://pmief.org/" target="_blank"> Educational Foundation</a> of the<a href="http://www.pmi.org/" target="_blank"> Project Management Institute</a> (PMI) is working with the<a href="http://www.p21.org/index.php" target="_blank"> Partnership for 21st Century Learning</a> (P21) to issue funding and support to three schools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.davenportschools.org/west/" target="_blank">Davenport West High School</a> (Davenport, IA): The school will implement a <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>-developed professional development programs for teachers as well as career-themed "academies";</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ranchocampanahigh.us/" target="_blank">Rancho Campana High School</a> (Camarillo, CA): The grant will be used to expand a current PBL model to 11th graders; and</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sbschools.org/schools/sbhs/" target="_blank">South Brunswick High School</a> (Southport, NC): This school will use the money to add an additional honors-level project management course for high school juniors and seniors.</li>

<p>In 2015,<a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2015/09/03/project-based-learning-gets-project-manager-make-over.aspx" target="_blank"> the two organizations worked together</a> on development of<a href="http://projectmanagement.p21.org/" target="_blank"> a toolkit</a> of resources to help schools introduce the practices of project management to their teachers and students.</p>
<p>P21 and PMI are using the latest round of the grants to help push 21st century learning; draw community members into working with schools and students; and increase awareness and use of project management and PBL to prepare students for college and careers.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that bringing in PBL and project management into schools helps students develop the skills necessary to be successful," said David Ross, CEO of P21, in a prepared statement. "Here at P21, we are excited to see the outcomes of these grants."</p>
