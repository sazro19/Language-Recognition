<p>K-12 schools deliver more IT services totally or partially  through the cloud, at an average of 42 percent of total IT services, than enterprise  in general, which delivers 35 percent of IT services via the cloud, according  to a new report from <a href="http://www.cdw.com/" target="_blank">CDW</a>. Despite the widespread use of cloud services, however, models of their financial impact are often inaccurate.</p>
<p>"The K-12 education cloud market has matured,  and many IT professionals are demanding more than just Cloud 101,"  according to information released by CDW. "They've already passed that  course and are ready for a deeper dive into the world of cloud, covering  details of migration, financial outcomes and barriers to further adoption."</p>
<p>The "<a href="http://www.cdwnewsroom.com/cdw-cloud-401-report/" target="_blank">CDW Cloud 401 Report</a>"  found that of those services delivered through the cloud in K-12 environments,  52 percent migrated from traditional delivery and 48 percent began in the  cloud. Storage made up the bulk of K-12 cloud services at 41 percent, computing  services accounted for 33 percent and applications made up the remainder at 26  percent.</p>

<p>The largest barriers to moving more services to the cloud,  according to respondents, are security (36 percent), trust in the solutions (29  percent) and fear of losing head count in the IT staff (21 percent).</p>

Respondents said that cost  estimates for their cloud services were only within 5 percent of actual cost 16  percent of the time. Ten percent of cloud service financial models were off by  more than 50 percent of actual cost, according to respondents.</p>
<p>Recommendations from districts with successful cloud  deployments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not be afraid to ask for help when you need  it or don't understand what's going on;</li>
<li>The margin for error is very small, but cloud  services can save money;</li>
<li>Make strong security protocols a priority;</li>
<li>"Have a realistic deployment plan and make  sure your IT people have been properly trained in all phases so that you have  redundancy across the whole department"; and</li>
<li>Perform due diligence, including looking into  uptime, security and safety, to select appropriate vendors.</li>
</ul>
