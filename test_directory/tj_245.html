<p>Richard Culatta is the new chief executive officer of the <a href="http://www.iste.org" target="_blank">International Society for Technology in Education</a>, or ISTE. He leads an active nonprofit organization of more than 16,500 members, with reach in 126 countries and programs that touch approximately 148,00 students and 100,000 education stakeholders.</p>
<p>Prior to joining ISTE on May 1, Culatta was the chief innovation officer for the state of Rhode Island —the first person to hold that position. He also served as director of the <a href="https://www.ed.gov" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Education</a>’s <a href="https://tech.ed.gov" target="_blank">Office of Educational Technology</a>, where he helped author the <a href="https://tech.ed.gov/netp/" target="_blank">National Educational Technology Plan</a>.</p>
<p>Culatta, 37, recently spoke with <em>THE Journal</em> about his experiences in education and ed tech, as well as his plans for ISTE as it prepares for its big <a href="http://conference.iste.org/2017/" target="_blank">summer conference</a> this month in San Antonio, TX. The father of four also discussed his vision for ISTE in the coming years.</p>

<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> Can you describe what you did in Rhode Island prior to joining ISTE?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Richard Culatta:</strong> I was the first chief innovation officer for the state; I reported to the governor. My role was to ask, “How can we use technology and new approaches to tackle tough problems?”</p>
<p>I grew up in Rhode Island. When I was asked, “Would you return to the state, and would you come and start this from scratch?” I said I’d love to! We accomplished some major initiatives around personalized learning, open educational resources, redesigning libraries and expanding infrastructure. The work of the innovation team in Rhode Island is still going strong and I continue to cheer them on from the sidelines.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> What does your job at ISTE entail? What’s the purpose of ISTE, from your perspective?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Culatta: </strong>ISTE is really focused on how we can use technology to help accelerate good practice in education, also help solve problems in education. I want to help make sure we are extending the reach of our services and offerings to as many education leaders as possible.</p>
<p>I also want educators to help us determine what are the areas we should focus on and what conversations ISTE should be hosting.</p>
<p>We’re also highlighting best practices of people who are doing amazing work. And frankly, we’re calling out practices that aren’t working out there. </p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> How many people are on staff at ISTE? Are you the boss of all of them? And what are some of your other responsibilities? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Culatta:</strong> We have a great team. There are about 50 people on the team. We also work with a number of partners, especially around large events, like our conference.</p>
<p>Our offices are based in the D.C. area, also in Portland.</p>
<p>At this point, my role is learning as quickly as I possibly can. We have our conference coming up — it’s one of the largest ed tech focused events in the world. It’s a pretty amazing endeavor, to pull off an event with over 20,000 people.</p>
<p>I’m going to be hosting some of the conversations we’re going to be holding there. I’ll also be connecting with our members, who are really deep experts in this work.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> What else do you hope to achieve with ISTE? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Culatta:</strong> We’re very interested in looking at how technology can be used to close equity gaps. We want to use technology to bring opportunity to students and families who may not have same opportunities as others.</p>
