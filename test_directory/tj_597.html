<p>"Passwords help protect individual and school data, but  they can also be a frustrating obstacle to accessing tools for student  learning, classroom management and school administration," said Robert  Iskander, general manager, in a prepared statement. "With SchoolMessenger  Passport, schools can make it easy for authorized users to access the Web-based  school administration and learning applications they need in a simple, safe and  secure way."</p>
<p>A free version of Passport is available for any districts in  North America, including those that do not use SchoolMessenger. A premium  version with additional functionality is also available.
