<p class="deck" id="ph_pcontent3_3_Deck">Teachers, materials, students — the big 3 of K–12. Materials (1-to-1, OER-based textbooks) are changing dramatically, but teachers and teaching is about to be disrupted in the Christensen-sense. Machine learning will drive personalized learning into America’s schools. On that you can rely!</p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.disrupt100.com/">on and on</a>… <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/12/top-7-disruptions-of-the-year/">and on</a>. But, while we may be tired from hearing about disruption — disruptions aren’t tired of happening! </p>
<p>And… TA DA… now, finally, YOUR child’s school is about to be disrupted!  "WHOA WHOA… Not so fast. <em>My</em> child’s school, disrupted? K-12 worked for me so it should work for my child. I am not so sure I want this disruption!"</p>
<p>Ahem, sorry, it doesn’t really matter what you want; without question, K-12 — and that means <em>your</em> child’s school — is about to be disrupted — hugely!  Read on, please.</p>
<p>A quick review: Here’s a description of a Christensen-style disruption from <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation">Christensen</a>, himself:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Disruption describes a process whereby a smaller company with fewer resources is able to successfully challenge established incumbent businesses. Specifically, as incumbents focus on improving their products and services for their most demanding (and usually most profitable) customers, they exceed the needs of some segments and ignore the needs of others. Entrants that prove disruptive begin by successfully targeting those overlooked segments, gaining a foothold by delivering more-suitable functionality — frequently at a lower price. Incumbents, chasing higher profitability in more-demanding segments, tend not to respond vigorously. Entrants then move upmarket, delivering the performance that incumbents’ mainstream customers require, while preserving the advantages that drove their early success. When mainstream customers start adopting the entrants’ offerings in volume, disruption has occurred."</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, K-12 isn’t a business in the strictest sense… but in another sense, K-12 is very much a business: it delivers a service at a price. If that service can be delivered at a lower cost and be more effective… well, bye-bye CDs/DVDs! </p>
<p>Up to now, K-12 has not experienced serious disruption. Yes, we have <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/03/01/511446388/just-what-is-a-charter-school-anyway">charter schools</a> and that may well have <em>felt</em> "disruptive."  But, the charter school disruption is not a Christensen-style disruption: generally speaking, charter schools <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3046738/charter-schools-have-an-awkward-secret-theyre-not-very-good-at-innovati">haven’t delivered</a> better education at a lower cost.  </p>
