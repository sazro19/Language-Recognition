<p>Should technology be able to prove its value in education?  That's a question Melissa Dodd doesn't see much meaning in. After all, she noted,  tech has become the new textbook. "And I don't think we used to ask about  the value of a textbook for learning." During her tenure as the Chief Technology  Officer at California's San Francisco Unified School District, Dodd has become  convinced that tech shows impact daily in meeting the needs of her school  system's 57,000 students. " We see the value of the  use of tech around student agency and voice and the ways in which it can help  enable students to make meaning of their learning, access learning and  demonstrate how they're learning."</p>
<p>To learn how technology leaders such as Dodd are responding  to a number of current challenges in their schools, THE Journal recently spoke  to five CTOs from around the country to understand the roles they play in  helping their teachers keep up with the use of tech for learning, whether their  1-to-1 efforts are remaining financially sustainable and what impact they have  on learning, what they can do as ESSA unfolds in their states, how they're  grappling with student data privacy and what they'd give up in their jobs if  they could.</p>

<h3>Project Tomorrow  recently released its annual <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2018/07/30/educators-largely-uncomfortable-with-newer-tech-based-teaching-practices.aspx" target="_blank">Speak  Up results</a> regarding digital learning. It found that 78 percent of teachers  were "not very comfortable" facilitating student use of digital  devices. What role can the IT organization play in addressing that?</h3>

<p>Melissa Dodd: On Monday we had about a thousand educators  come together for what we call our <a href="https://tech.sfusd.edu/resources-and-training/digital-learning/digital-district-day" target="_blank">Digital  District Day</a>. It's a day of hands-on engaging learning on building  teachers' essential skills so that they can help their students build those  skills. We do one-hour workshops and they can put together their schedule based  on their interest areas, content areas, grade levels. They personalize their  learning for the day. Then we offer additional learning opportunities that are  both face to face as well as online throughout the year. The other thing we do is  [team] up with our curriculum partners to weave in technologies so teachers are  building their comfort level as they're learning content or instructional  practices and strategies.</p>
<p>Daniel Smith: The older, more seasoned generation of  teachers is retiring out. I spent a decade handholding teachers just on:  "Click on the selection on the screen." "Do I left-click or right-click?"  "Well, try one and if that doesn't work try the other one. You have a  50-50 chance." Fast forward to yesterday. I did an orientation for new  teachers. My normal three-hour spiel was cut down to 40 minutes because I could  go straight to the meat-and-potatoes—"Let me give you some great examples  of what good teaching and learning looks like with technology integrated as a  seamless piece." Our teachers are becoming more digital natives as time  goes on.</p>
<p>Pete Just: We started using <a href="https://www.brightbytes.net/" target="_blank">BrightBytes</a> five years ago. Twice  a year, we're doing self-assessments and tracking how teachers feel. It is  important to get an idea of what they feel about the adoption of these devices,  these tools that we've provided for their students. What we've seen is that  it's been slow, but the classroom part of that evaluation has gone up maybe one  or two percent every single time we've asked. We have a nice trajectory, and I  think that this is going to continue. What we saw this year actually was a bit  of an inflection point, where we increased at a greater rate than we ever had  before. We're starting to see teachers understand the value that we can bring  in terms of efficiency and in terms of access with these opportunities that  they hadn't seen before.</p>
