<p>More
than 10 million students gained access to high-speed Internet at school
last year, bringing the total to 34.9 million. However, 11.6 million
students are still languishing on the other side of the broadband
divide, according to the <a href="http://stateofthestates.educationsuperhighway.org/" target="_blank">2016 State of the States</a> report from <a href="https://www.educationsuperhighway.org/" target="_blank">EducationSuperHighway</a>. </p>
<p>The
nonprofit group partners with governors and state agencies to identify
school districts in need of Internet service upgrades and help them
source options.  EducationSuperHighway today released its
second-annual State of the States report, which details gains in K-12
broadband connectivity and examines the factors contributing to those
gains. It then delves into the issue of the connectivity gap and offers
suggestions to further reduce that gap.</p>
<p>First, the good news:</p>

<ul>
<li>88
    percent of school districts now meet the FCC's minimum Internet access
    goal of 100 kilobits per second (Kbps) per student, up from 76 percent
    in 2015;</li>
<li>5
    states — Hawaii, Kentucky, North Dakota, South Carolina and Wyoming —
    have connected 100 percent of their students to high-speed broadband;</li>
<li>34.9 million students now have at least 100 Kbps per student Internet at school, up from 24.5 million in 2015;</li>
<li>15 percent of school districts have already met the FCC's goal of 1 megabit per second (Mbps) per student by 2018;</li>
<li>95 percent of schools now have a fiber-optic connection, which is critical for scaling up bandwidth in the future; and</li>
<li>83 percent of schools have sufficient WiFi in classrooms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, the bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>19,208
    schools serving 11.6 million students still do not meet the FCC's
    minimum Internet access goal of 100 Kbps per student, although these
    numbers have improved significantly since 2015;</li>
<li>3,723, mostly in rural areas, lack the fiber-optic infrastructure required to meet broadband targets; and</li>
<li>15,092 schools have insufficient WiFi in classrooms.</li>
</ul>
<p>The
report also goes into considerable depth on the issue of cost, the
number one reason why many schools aren't meeting broadband targets.
According to the report, "districts that do not meet the FCC's 100 kbps
per student minimum threshold pay 2.3 times more for their bandwidth
than districts meeting the FCC goal." The report goes on to say that,
"the path to connecting these students is not to lower the school
districts' monthly costs, but rather to significantly increase the
bandwidth they receive for the amount they (or their states) are
already spending on Internet access."</p>
<p>Internet service providers
(ISPs) have been crucial to gains made in K-12 connectivity. According
to the report, technological advancements have enabled service
providers to upgrade school bandwidth without increasing costs. In
2016, "39 percent of districts were able to upgrade while also lowering
or maintaining their monthly cost for Internet access." ISPs have also
improved broadband accessibility by extending their networks to
underserved schools. </p>
<p>Despite the gains, work remains to be
done. The report concludes with action plans for governors, service
providers and school districts, detailing steps each of these groups
can take to accelerate broadband upgrades in schools.</p>
<p>The State
of the States report is based on analysis of 2016 FCC E-rate data,
which represents 10,499 school districts, 73,000 schools and more than
38 million students.</p>
