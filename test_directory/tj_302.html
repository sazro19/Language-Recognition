<p><strong>Welcome to 21<sup>st</sup> Century Skills</strong></p>
<p>"…grade school teaching techniques continued to move away from recitation, rote memorization, seat work. A new ‘project-problem’ method was introduced to teach pupils to reason and to ‘socialize and develop power in oral exposition,’ instead of just repeating answers. A generalized statement was given to a student to prove. This required using various sources, determining relevant parts of the proof, and organizing a convincing talk."</p>
<p>The first words in the paragraph above were "In 1911-1912." Bryce Nelson’s 1988 book <em>Good Schools: The Seattle Public School System, 1901-1930</em> describes a remarkable system that lasted 20 years. In <em>The Right to Learn</em>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G_vWcS1NTA">Linda Darling-Hammond</a> documents subsequent ‘21<sup>st</sup> century skills’ movements in the 1930s, 1960s and 1990s. "Each decade another set of fads emerges (often recycled ideas with new names).” There were successes, but they faded away. Why?</p>

<p>Some say that secondary schools cannot fix problems that are entrenched before students arrive, so we must first attend to primary, pre-school and pre-natal education, and address poverty, health care and community involvement. Children in countries that offer such benefits do better. But we won’t right these ills soon, and Darling-Hammond described city schools that succeeded despite such challenges.</p>
<p>A more radical approach is to also<em> replace the standard curriculum content</em>. Critics such as Andrew "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Hacker">The math myth</a>" Hacker and Roger "<a href="http://educationoutrage.blogspot.com/2016/12/last-week-i-spoke-at-online-education.html">Education Outrage</a>" Schank advocate the elimination of requirements for higher math, science, foreign languages and other core topics. Why shouldn’t students “learn to learn” while focusing on useful subjects of stronger interest, rather than material their parents don’t know and that they will quickly forget, such as trigonometry, state capitals and the Franco-Prussian wars?</p>
<p>Of course, everyone should have some knowledge of literature, history, government, mathematics and science. But making kids grind through them year after year isn’t working well, and there are potentially more engaging and important ways for students to learn to learn.</p>
<p>A recent World Economic Forum report, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-future-of-jobs"><em>The Future of Jobs</em></a>, forecasts that 65% of children entering primary school today will end up in jobs that don’t yet exist. Looking around, I see myriad jobs that didn’t exist twenty ago. I also see higher education majors that didn’t exist: bachelor’s degrees in greenhouse operation, resort management, ecogastronomy, meeting and event planning, theme park engineering and scores of others. Not long ago, majors were more uniformly aligned with the secondary school curriculum.</p>
<p><em>If high schools do not acquaint students with the range of career options, students may not select a university that offers a good match, or they may not find that match when pressed to quickly declare a major.</em> Parents can’t tell them about jobs that didn’t exist several years ago. For example, beer-making (or fermentation science — excellent job prospects for graduates!) is a major in two dozen colleges and universities. A student who doesn’t apply to one of them or discover the major could miss her calling.</p>
<p>I can <em>prove </em>that two years of high school is wasted for "normal" students. In my state, high school juniors and seniors can take a 10-week community college English (or math, science, etc.) course and earn credit for a full year of high school <em>and</em> university credit that can be transferred to other universities. A student with some discipline can <em>finish high school</em> <em>with an associate degree</em> <em>and enter university as a junior, skipping two full years</em>. By foregoing AP classes, they preclude applying to elite universities, but many get respectable bachelor’s degrees at ages 19-21 and are no worse off for it.</p>
