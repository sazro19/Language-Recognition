<p>Microsoft has unveiled  new Windows 10 devices designed to compete with Chromebooks on price; an update  to <a href="https://education.minecraft.net/" target="_blank">Minecraft for Education</a>; and a  new tool for managing classroom devices, <a href="https://info.microsoft.com/US-WNDWS-CNTNT-FY17-01Jan-17-IntuneforEducationlandingpageandnurture292531_01Registration-ForminBody.html" target="_blank">Intune  for Education</a>.</p>
<p>A cloud-based application and device management service "specially  designed for schools who want to put devices in classrooms and not touch them  again for the rest of the school year, Intune for Education makes it easy for  either IT admins, or teachers playing the role of IT in the classroom, to get  up-and-running in minutes on Windows 10 devices and easily manage shared  devices," according to a news release.</p>
<p>Features of Intune for Education, debuting at this week's <a href="http://www.bettshow.com/" target="_blank">BETT conference</a> in London, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An express setup tool designed to implement  default policies for devices and users in a class, school or district in  minutes;</li>
<li>The ability to customize more than 150  settings, assign them to a student — who they can follow to any device they  sign in to — and then apply them to hardware, browsers, apps, start menus, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-defender" target="_blank">Windows  Defender</a> and more;</li>
<li>Teachers and admins can enroll a handful of  devices by logging in with an Office 365 e-mail account or enroll many devices  using the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/set-up-school-pcs/9nblggh4ls40" target="_blank">Set  up School PCs app</a>;</li>
<li>Integration with School Data Sync that allows  Intune for Education to automatically create groups based on roster data and  update those groups as roster changes are made; and</li>
<li>Integration with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/system-center-configuration-manager" target="_blank">System  Center Configuration Manager</a> for cross-platform support.</li>
