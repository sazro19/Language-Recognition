<p><a href="http://www.lcisd.org/" target="_blank">Lamar Consolidated Independent School 
District</a> in the greater Houston area will provide students in a 
pre-kindergarten summer program with laptops and school-managed WiFi hotspots 
to access online educational content. </p>
<p>Students in the program need extra preparation before they start Kindergarten 
in the fall, so the district has launched a pilot program to help them work on 
their early reading skills over the summer while they are at home or away on 
vacation.</p>
<p>Each student will receive a laptop and a
<a href="http://www.kajeet.com/4u/education/Smartspot.html" target="_blank">Kajeet SmartSpot</a> 
WiFi hotspot on the Sprint 4G LTE network, so they can access educational 
resources on the Internet anywhere the Spring 4G LTE network is available. </p>
<p>“We want to help these students work on early reading skills in an online, 
fun environment," said Chad Jones, director of technology development at Lamar 
CISD, in a prepared statement. "Our hope is that this program will stop any sort 
of summer regression these students may experience, while also hopefully 
increasing their skill level.”</p>

<p>The district will use
<a href="http://www.kajeet.com/4u/education/Smartspot/Sentinel.html" target="_blank">Kajeet 
Sentinel</a> to filter student Internet access, controlling which sites they can 
access and when. The district will be able to limit access to educational 
content only and turn off the hotspot at night. Filtering Internet content and 
hours of access is intended to help keep the kids safe online and also control 
program costs. </p>
<p>Approximately half of the students in the district are financially 
disadvantaged and qualify for the free or reduced-cost lunch program, and Kajeet 
describes SmartSpot at "an affordable and simple option to bridge the digital 
divide."</p>
