<p><a href="https://nearpod.com/" target="_blank">Nearpod</a>, a company that offers tools to sync resources and content across students’ iPads, iPhones, iPods or Macs, has updated its iOS app. The latest version features an improved interface that increases accessibility for teachers and grants them greater control over students’ devices. </p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nearpod/id523540409?mt=8" target="_blank">Version 9.5 </a>has given a “facelift” to its Teacher Dashboard (on iPad only), rearranging the interface to include “everything a teacher needs to navigate a lesson or monitor their students” all in one place, according to the <a href="https://blog.nearpod.com/whats-new-nearpod-9-5-is-now-available-for-ios/" target="_blank">blog post announcement</a>. For example, teachers can insert On the Fly activities like “Draw it” or “Poll” during live sessions simply by using the drop-down in the upper-right corner of the screen. Additionally, the student roster has been moved to the bottom of the toolbar.</p>

<p>On iPads and iPhones, teachers now have the ability to maintain multiple sessions of the same lesson at once, the blog post explained. They can even control audio and video across from their iPad and iPhone across students’ devices when they presenting slides that contain audio or video, pausing and adjusting volume when needed.</p>
