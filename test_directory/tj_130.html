<p>The Microsoft Teams app can now be deployed on Surface Hub devices. Surface Hub is Microsoft's large touchscreen conference  room device for online meetings that includes whiteboarding,  Skype communications and  Office applications.   Teams is Microsoft's collaboration client application that's  slated to replace  Skype for Business, although the two applications currently  can be run side by side. Microsoft <a href="https://redmondmag.com/articles/2018/08/24/teams-skype-for-business-replacement.aspx" target="_blank">recently  suggested</a> that the  Teams client can now serve as a suitable  replacement for the Skype for Business client. </p>
<p>The  Teams app for Surface Hub devices previously was  available as test software through Microsoft's <a href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Windows Insider Program</a> and as a <a href="https://redmondmag.com/articles/2018/06/12/microsoft-teams-conference-room-devices.aspx" target="_blank">preview  in the Microsoft Store</a>. Now it's available "for all Surface Hubs."  However, those devices must be running "Windows 10 Team Edition OS  1703.15063.1292 (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4343889/windows-10-update-kb4343889" target="_blank">KB4343889</a>, August 30, 2018) or later," Microsoft's <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/surface/2018/09/18/download-the-microsoft-teams-app-for-surface-hub-app/" target="_blank">announcement  on Tuesday</a> indicated. </p>

<p>The "Team edition" of Windows 10 is actually the  name of the operating system that runs on Surface Hub devices. It's based on  the Windows 10 Enterprise edition, but it has a slightly modified user  interface that's optimized for meetings, according to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/surface-hub/differences-between-surface-hub-and-windows-10-enterprise" target="_blank">this  Microsoft document</a>. </p>
<p><span class="a12blub">Installation and  Configuration</span><br/>
The  Teams app for Surface Hub devices is available  either from "the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-teams-for-surface-hub-preview/9pczm4lgf8s6?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a> or from the Microsoft Store for  Business," Microsoft's announcement explained. The Microsoft Store for  Business is a storage space that organizations can use to distribute  applications to end users. The Microsoft Store is an online repository managed  by Microsoft that houses Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps vetted by Microsoft.</p>
<p>The  Teams app for Surface Hub devices won't arrive  through the Windows Update service. It has to be downloaded using the Surface  Hub device or installed from the Windows Store for Business using a management application,  such as Microsoft Intune. </p>
<p>The app has to be configured after installation before  launching it, Microsoft's announcement warned. Microsoft has supplied three  provisioning packages for the purpose, which can be stored on a USB drive. </p>
<p>IT pros have to specify a mode, indicated by numbers "0,"  "1" or "2," to specify the configuration of the app. Which  mode they choose is dependent on how they use the  Teams and Skype for  Business clients. Here are the three configuration options, along with  Microsoft's recommendations, per the announcement:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><strong>Mode       0 - Keep as is. </strong><br/>
<em>Use this mode if your organization still uses Skype for Business       primarily, but you want the ability to join Microsoft Teams meetings from       Surface Hub.</em></li>
<li><strong>Mode       1 - Microsoft Teams Hybrid.</strong><br/>
    The Microsoft Teams 'Call' tile will appear on the Welcome Screen.<br/>
    The Microsoft Teams tile on the Start Menu will replace the default Skype       for Business tile and will show the Microsoft Teams client when launched.       You will also see the one-touch 'Join' button to join scheduled Microsoft       Teams meetings.<br/>
    Scheduled Skype for Business meetings will launch the Skype for Business       client when you hit the one-touch 'Join' button for Skype for Business       meetings.<br/>
<em>Use this mode if you're transitioning to Microsoft Teams from Skype for       Business and/or your organization uses Microsoft Teams primarily, but you       want the ability to join Skype for Business meetings.</em></li>
<li><strong>Mode       2 - Microsoft Teams.</strong><br/>
    The Microsoft Teams tiles are displayed on the Welcome Screen and Start       Menu. All Skype for Business functionalities are disabled.<br/>
<em>Use this mode if you're only using Microsoft Teams.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft has separate instructions if an organization is  using  Intune to configure the  Teams app on Surface Hub  devices. It involves creating a device configuration profile using "configuration  service providers," as explained in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/provisioning-packages/how-it-pros-can-use-configuration-service-providers" target="_blank">this  Microsoft document</a>. </p>
<p>Lastly, IT pros will have to restart the Surface Hub device  for the app to start working.</p>
