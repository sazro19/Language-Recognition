<p>Two
school districts in Yuma, AZ are now connected to a city-wide fiber
optic wide area network (WAN), providing 25 schools and administrative
buildings with 10 gigabit per second (Gbps) internet access.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.yumaunion.org/pages/Yuma_Union_HighSchool_Dist" target="_blank">Yuma Union High School District</a> and <a href="http://www.yuma.org/" target="_blank">Yuma Elementary School District One</a> have both implemented digital learning initiatives, including a 1-to-1
netbook program at the high school district, which provides every
student in the district with a netbook to access e-textbooks and other
digital learning resources. The districts' legacy networks could not
provide sufficient bandwidth for these digital programs, so <a href="http://www.yumaunion.org/pages/Yuma_Union_HighSchool_Dist/District/Yuma_Educational_Consortium" target="_blank">Yuma Educational Technology Consortium</a>, which jointly supports both school districts, signed a long term agreement to lease the 10 Gbps WAN connection from <a href="http://wanrack.com/" target="_blank">WANRack</a>,
a company that provides high-bandwidth, fiber-based communications
networks and related services to schools throughout the United States.</p>

<p>WANRack
has now completed construction of the 33 mile private fiber network,
which offers a total of 240 gigabits for the city of Yuma and 10
gigabits per site. WANRack's design model enables it to provide lit or
dark fiber connections, and the company claims it can provide "superior
bandwidth, scalability and security as compared to traditional cable or
telephone company offerings, often at a significant cost savings,"
according to a news release.</p>
<p>"The best part was turning the
service on for the first time; there were zero issues and our new
10-Gigabit service has continued to work flawlessly since," said Dean
Farar, director of technology for the Yuma Educational Technology
Consortium. We couldn't be happier with the results!"</p>
