<p><a href="http://www.durantisd.org/" target="_blank">Durant Independent School District</a> (ISD) in Oklahoma has selected a new student information system (SIS) and the
new system will go live in the summer of 2015.</p>
<p>Durant ISD recently learned that its existing SIS would be going
"end-of-life," meaning the vendor would no longer be supporting it, so it needed
to find a replacement SIS. Decision makers talked to other districts in the
state about their experiences with other systems, and they requested product
demonstrations from a variety of vendors. </p>
<p>Based on those discussions and demonstrations, the district selected <a href="http://www.infinitecampus.com/" target="_blank">Infinite Campus</a>, which is a
state-approved SIS vendor. According to Andi Hudson, director of technology at
Durant ISD, the other districts had "very positive" things to say about the
product and Durant's selection committee was most impressed with Infinite
Campus's product demonstration, "primarily because of its comprehensive
functionality," Hudson said in a prepared statement.</p>
