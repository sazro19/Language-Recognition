<p>Less than a week after pledging to <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/10/07/nyc-libraries-to-offer-5000-wifi-hotspots-to-students-families.aspx" target="_blank">give away 5,000 free WiFi hotspots</a> to families in New York City, <a href="https://business.sprint.com/?ECID=vanity%3Abusiness" target="_blank">Sprint</a> has expanded its commitment and will now provide free wireless devices to 1 million high school students nationwide.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center</a>, 5 million families in the United States with school-aged children lack Internet access at home. With nearly two-thirds of teachers assigning Internet-based homework, many students face a “<a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/07/28/home-connectivity-and-the-homework-gap.aspx" target="_blank">homework gap</a>” when they go from a digital oasis at school to a digital desert at home. The lack of Internet access creates obstacles to learning, forcing students without broadband to go to great lengths to complete homework assignments.</p>

<p>Sprint’s <a href="http://goodworks.sprint.com/1millionproject/?ECID=vanity:1millionproject" target="_blank">1Million Project</a> is the largest corporate initiative in the United States aimed at bridging the digital divide and closing the homework gap. Scheduled to begin early in 2017, the multiyear initiative targets low-income, U.S. high school students without reliable home Internet access. For the initiative, Sprint and the <a href="http://goodworks.sprint.com/people/communities/sprint-foundation/" target="_blank">Sprint Foundation</a> will work with nonprofit agencies to recruit community organizations such as schools, libraries and public housing authorities, to locally deliver and install the Sprint devices – which will either be a smartphone, tablet, laptop or hotspot device. Students can use 3GB of high-speed LTE data per month, with unlimited data available at 2G speeds when the 3GB runs out.</p>
<p>“Education is the foundation for our society to prosper, and the internet is an incredibly powerful tool for learning,” said Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, in a statement. “But it’s a huge problem in America that we have 5 million households with children that lack internet connections. Those kids have a huge disadvantage and we are failing them. All of us at Sprint are committed to changing this by providing 1 million students in need with free devices and free wireless connections.” </p>
<p>Sprint will pilot the program in seven to 10 markets before rolling out the whole plan for 2017-2018 school year. The company seeks to reach its goal of a million students in five years.</p>
