<p>Most K-12 districts lack a dedicated cybersecurity staffer. According
to a recent survey by the <a href="https://www.cosn.org/">Consortium
for School Networking (CoSN)</a>, 23% of school systems
have a full-time employee dedicated to network security. The survey
among 390 participants found that urban districts were the most
likely (41%) to have a cybersecurity specialist on staff, while rural
and town districts were least likely (each with 15%); 19% of suburban
districts reported a specialist.</p>
<p>The "<a href="https://www.cosn.org/about/news/cybersecurity-remains-edtech-leaders%E2%80%99-no-1-priority-2021-focus-digital-equity-and-access">Ed
Tech Leadership Survey Report</a>" found that the
lack of a dedicated position was made up for in 53% of districts by
spreading the responsibility across several roles. A third (32%)
combined network security with one other position. Six percent
outsourced the work. And six percent dealt with incidents in an "ad
hoc" manner, which the report called "arguably the worst
approach to adopt." Without a "formal [security] strategy,"
author Paula Maylahn noted, "they put themselves, their
students' data, and staff's data at risk."</p>

<p>Cybersecurity
training isn't readily adopted by schools. Half of districts said
they require training for all staff, with another 18% planning to do
so. A sliver of respondents said teachers are currently or will be
required to be trained (3%) and only 2% said the same about
administrators and support staff. This too is far from being best
practice. As the report noted, "TRAIN, TRAIN, TRAIN! Make sure
everyone knows security awareness is their job and who to talk to if
they make a mistake."</p>
<p>One bright spot is
that backup and offsite storage are in use by more than seven in 10
districts (72%). However, the report added, those practices in
themselves won't stop attacks. Among the strategies in use in K-12:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Training IT
	staff, used by 70% of respondents;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Regular
	updating of passwords (63%);</p>
</li><li>
<p>Using
	cybersecurity software (63%);</p>
</li><li>
<p>Using intrusion
	detection (54%);</p>
</li><li>
<p>Using
	encryption (43%);</p>
</li><li>
<p>Running
	cybersecurity audits (41%);</p>
</li><li>
<p>Developing
	formal cybersecurity plans (41%);</p>
</li><li>
<p>Including
	security safeguards in vendor negotiations (37%);</p>
</li><li>
<p>Using
	two-factor authentication (29%);</p>
</li><li>
<p>Pulling
	together a cybersecurity team (22%);</p>
</li><li>
<p>Creating a
	cybersecurity line-item in the budget (18%); and</p>
</li><li>
<p>Using more
	complex encryption (18%).</p>
</li></ul>
<p>In spite of <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-345a">evidence</a>
that the education sector is a ripe target for criminal exploitation,
84% of district IT leaders don't rate cybersecurity as a big risk. As
the survey found, not a single type of threat received a high-risk
rating by a majority of participants -- not even phishing, which just
16% rated as a high risk and 29% rated as a medium/high risk. More
than half of the respondents (54%) said they had a "relatively
high degree of confidence" in their abilities to address
cybersecurity events as they surfaced.</p>
<p>One level of
preparation was the purchase of cybersecurity insurance, which is on
the rise. While 18% of districts bought dedicated policies in 2020,
that shot to 32% in 2021. At the same time, including such coverage
as part of an umbrella policy declined, from 56% to 49%. The report
suggested that the decline was possibly due to "limitations
found in umbrella policies, which tend to provide inadequate coverage
for a cybersecurity incident." Choosing a dedicated
cybersecurity policy, however, comes with greater responsibility, the
report stated: "Cybersecurity insurers may demand greater 'cyber
hygiene' from the policy holder and stipulate conditions, such as
regular phishing security tests or use of multifactor
authentication." Also, the cost is going up as the number of
attacks on K-12 rise. Still, the number of school systems that don't
purchase cybersecurity insurance fell from 20% last year to 12% this
year.</p>
<p>This year's CoSN
survey and report were conducted with the support of <a href="https://www.cdw.com/">CDW•G</a>
and the <a href="https://www.ed-fi.org/">Ed-Fi
Alliance</a>, and in partnership with <a href="https://www.aasa.org/home/">AASA,
