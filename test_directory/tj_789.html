<p>Oklahoma's <a href="http://www.altusschools.k12.ok.us/district/" target="_blank">Altus Public Schools</a> has  launched a 1:1 computing initiative in an effort to provide personalized  digital learning and integrate technology skills practice with the classroom.</p>
<p>The first  step of the four-phase project, dubbed the Digital Learning Initiative, was  launched this school year, when all teachers and certified staff were issued  MacBook Air laptops preloaded with software for use in curriculum. "Teachers  will use laptops and related technology to enhance communication,  collaboration, organization, and production in all classes and subject areas,"  according to <a href="http://www.altustimes.com/news/news/151080692/Digital-Learning-Initiative-to-launch-Schools-to-hold-Parent-orientation-meetings" target="_blank">a  report</a> in the Altus Times.</p>
<p>The second  phase of the project is launching in the second semester of this school year,  when all students at <a href="http://ais.altusps.com/" target="_blank">Altus Intermediate  School</a> and <a href="http://ajh.altusps.com/" target="_blank">Altus Junior High School</a> will receive iPads for use at school and home, with access to learning  resources via the district's network.</p>
