<ul class="byline" id="ph_pcontent3_3_ByAuthor">

<p>The most common form of phishing email in education tends to  include an attached invoice; 66 percent of hacker attempts use the attached  invoice ploy to get unwary recipients to click on an infected link; another 28  percent use a payment notification scheme; and 6 percent try online order  tricks.</p>
<p>The findings were shared by digital security vendor <a href="https://cofense.com/" target="_blank">Cofense</a>, in its  "<a href="https://cofense.com/whitepaper/state-of-phishing-defense-2018/" target="_blank">State of  Phishing Defense 2018</a>" report. The company provides online  services to organizations that automates response to suspicious emails and also  helps them condition their employees to recognize and report phishing. (In  other words, the company facilitates employers sending fake emails to test how  savvy their workforce is.) For the report, Cofense used data gathered through  the experiences of 1,400 clients in 23 industries around the world covering  real attack attempts correlated with customer simulation data.</p>
<p>The same analysis found that 11 percent of malicious emails in  education reported turned out to be actual phishing attempts, slightly higher  than the cross-industry rate of 10 percent. The others were ordinary emails  that users just thought were fake. Of course, as the report's authors pointed  out, "It takes just one successful phish to inflict a costly toll."</p>

<p>The top phishing campaigns tended to use "invoice"  in the subject header. That word appeared in seven of the top 10 headers for  actual phishes. Also highly popular: "payment remittance,"  "statement" and "payment."</p>
<p>More than half of reported phishes across all segments (53  percent) were sent to collect user logins, according to Cofense. This  "credential phishing" typically includes a link to a malicious  landing page, enabling criminals to gain access to internal data or  "establish a network foothold." To protect against this delivery  mechanism for malware, the company recommended that organizations use a "steady  diet of credential phishing" in their simulation programs., particularly  if the operation uses a lot of cloud services.</p>
<p>The report, which called Microsoft Office macros "the  Domino's of malware delivery," said that nearly half of all malware analyzed  (45 percent) currently "lurks" in Office macros. One option is for  schools to disable macros in emails, forcing users to "enable"  content before they work with it. Another approach is to block or  "gray-list" documents from both known malware sources and unknown  sites and balance that with user education.</p>
<p>The security firm recommended that organizations train users  "to view attachments suspiciously," especially if they include  invoices, online orders or anything that might contain a macro. Also, users need  to be on the watch especially during intense periods of financial processing, such as  end-of-month, end-of-quarter and end-of-year periods.</p>
<p>Cofense also suggested that organizations run phishing  simulations based on real threats and the newest subjects or themes that have  been circulating.</p>
<p>"We see phishing emails bypass technology controls  every day and more and more end-users recognizing and reporting these threats  that slipped past million-dollar defenses," said Aaron Higbee, co-founder  and chief technology officer of Cofense, in a statement. "The results of  our research...shows that resiliency is building across key industries thanks  to those same people that were once deemed as the weakest-links in an  organization. These trends are powerful and reinforce that humans are a key  element to a successful security program."</p>
