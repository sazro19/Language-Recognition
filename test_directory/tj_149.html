<p>If your idea of the Internet of  Things (IoT) involves smart environments that hoover up data from wearable  sensors for more efficient traffic patterns, alert a teacher when a student's  eyeballs have wandered away from the lesson or notify purchasing when the  pencil stock has dwindled in the supply closet, maybe it's time to crank back  expectations and look at what's really going on in K–12 with IoT.</p>

<h3>What Is  IoT?</h3>
<p>The Internet of Things describes the idea of common objects  being connected to the internet to generate and exchange data. For example, a beacon  could send out a signal to another system, such as a phone, to log a bit of  data and let it know that something — or someone — is there and present.</p>
</div>
<p>According to Steve Burt, the  applications for IoT in the school environment currently most often involve  lighting, climate control and transportation. Burt is the director of strategy  for <a href="https://www.clarity-innovations.com/">Clarity Innovations</a>,  a professional services firm that consults with education agencies,  organizations and companies on technology. So far, he noted, retail is a far  better venue for IoT usage than education, collecting data "to help them  essentially do their job, selling things better."</p>

<p>Data collection in  schools is a far trickier business, Burt said, burdened with practical,  political and legal ramifications "that are going to continue to exist as a  barrier to widespread implementation or adoption." Anybody who proposes putting  sensors in buildings to track student activity will face a school board  that doesn't hear, "I'm trying to track usage," he suggested; they're going to  hear, "I'm going to be tracking what students are doing and where they're at."  And that's a non-starter. "The political concerns will throw up a lot of red  flags around that."</p>
<p>Yet, as Burt pointed out, there are countless IoT uses that  could really help schools streamline operations, save money and reduce  administrivia. Think about the cafeteria. While CES scenarios offer up smart  refrigerators and connected inventory, a more practical use is managing student  meals. "That has always been the bane of schools to have to manage school lunch  tickets and who gets credit for free-and-reduced lunch and what to do when the  kid has forgotten his milk money. I think that's an opportunity." Students can  be supplied with a card that doesn't necessarily identify them but does tie to  a lunch-money or free-meal account.</p>
<h3>Signaling Bus Usage</h3>
<p>The cafeteria usage is similar to the application of a system  in place at Colorado's <a href="https://www.adams12.org/">Adams 12 Five Star  Schools</a>. When students board or disembark school buses, they wave an RFID  card at a small cell-phone-sized device that logs their arrival or departure,  including time and location. The <a href="https://www.zonarsystems.com/solutions/z-pass-student-tracking/">Zonar Z  Pass system</a> has been in use at the district since 2010, said David  Anderson, director of Transportation &amp; Fleet. It covers about 11,000 kids  who ride one of 163 buses.</p>

<p>Originally, noted Anderson, the tech was brought in to  handle accounting. Families were charged based on their students' ridership.  But two years ago, the school board eliminated the bus fee, and now it has  turned into a safety, security and risk management feature. "We know what  students are on the bus. We have accountability. We know when they get off," he  said. "If a student is lost or there are any questions about it, we can say, 'Your  student got off at First and Main at 3:23 in the afternoon.' It time-stamps it  and through GPS it's very accurate." That isn't simply a theoretical notion, he  added. Parents call all the time to find out if their kids made it off the  school bus.</p>
