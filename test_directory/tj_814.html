<p>According to Chief Technology Officer Brandt Redd, the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium saw “significantly” fewer problems than it had expected during its spring 2014 field tests. “Things went more smoothly than our expectations,” said Redd. “We didn't have any systemwide issues; issues that happened tended to be isolated." That lack of major issues was in large part due to the efforts of educators all over the country who put in the time to make sure everything would work before nearly 5 million students showed up to take the field tests — whether for Smarter Balanced, PARCC or one of the alternative state online initiatives. The lessons that the field testers learned last spring can help you prepare so that your school or district's experience with the real deal goes as smoothly as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Prioritize Your Infrastructure </strong></p>
<p>Even before Dennis Villano, director of technology integration for <a href="http://www.burlington.org/residents/schools/burlington_public_schools/index.php"><strong>Burlington Public Schools</strong></a> (MA), had ever heard of PARCC, his district was investing in a broadband and wireless infrastructure that could eventually sustain a 1-to-1 program. “For us, it was about education,” he said. “It was about implementing technology into the environment.” </p>
<p>Lately, though, Villano has been hearing a lot of school tech directors “talk about the devices first.” That's the wrong approach, he asserted. “You have to talk about the infrastructure first. Get that working, get that up to speed, spend the money where you need to there, and then talk about the devices.”</p>
<p>According to Jesús Aguirre, state superintendent of education, local education agencies within the District of Columbia each received a share of a $4 million allotment to help them get ready for the PARCC field testing and the live assessment. (Another round of funding was distributed in October.) DC gave individual schools the choice of spending the money on new devices or on infrastructure since, as Aguirre noted, “Every school is different. They’re going to make the better decision about what they need.” To make the most informed decision possible, it can help for tech leaders and staff to turn their priorities into a shopping list that you can consult when funding becomes available. </p>
<p><strong>Do a Dry Run</strong></p>
<p>The biggest piece of technology advice that came out of the field testing, according to Redd, was the importance of doing a dry run. Redd offered this example: If you're taking a room that's normally used for other purposes and dedicating it to testing, you may find that once you've packed it with “30 computers and 30 people, the air conditioning isn't adequate to keep it cool. It's not the thing you'd think of right off the bat.” Another possible scenario: You find out too late there isn't enough power to run all the systems.</p>
<p>Then there are the IT concerns, he noted, such as the wireless access point that serves that room: “Does it have sufficient capacity for that many computers and bandwidth need? You might have enough Internet bandwidth coming into the school, but it may be that the access point that serves a particular sector of the school was expecting a dozen devices, and all of a sudden you have 30 or 40, and it's not built for that much capacity.”</p>
