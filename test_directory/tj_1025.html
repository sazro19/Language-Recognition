<p><a href="http://www.ousd.k12.ca.us/" target="_blank">Oakland Unified School District</a> 
 in California plans to implement more than 8,000 Chromebook laptops in 
 classrooms for grades 3 through 12.</p>
<p>According to  Gary Yee, superintendent of OUSD, the 
initial goal of the implementation was to "give all students access to a 
reliable wireless device" and also to "meet the state requirements for online 
assessment." California school districts are required to complete a
<a href="http://www.smarterbalanced.org/" target="_blank">Smarter Balanced</a> assessment field 
test for students in grades 3 to 8 and grade 11 this spring, and the Chromebooks 
meet the system requirements for the online assessments.</p>
<p>The district selected
<a href="http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/chromebook-11/pd" target="_blank">Dell Chromebook 11</a> 
laptops, which feature an Intel Haswell 2955U 1.4 Ghz processor and 4 GB of DDR3 
memory, as well as an 11.6-inch screen, stereo sound and a webcam. The laptops 
run Google's Chrome operating system, and student files are stored in the cloud 
so they can access them from anywhere on any device with a browser. According to 
Yee, the Chromebooks will enable teachers to personalize learning for students.

<p>Before delivering the Chromebooks, Dell will set them up on the OUSD
<a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/education/" target="_blank">Google Apps for 
Education</a> domain, asset-tag them and laser etch them with the OUSD logo, 
according information from the company. Once the devices are on site, Dell will 
also test them to ensure they are configured correctly and can access the 
wireless network. Dell will then hand-off management of the devices to OUSD 
information technology staff, who will remotely manage the Chromebooks to 
install updates, add or remove apps as needed and enforce safe-browsing 
policies. The devices will be stored in secure charging carts in the schools.
</p>
<p>The Chromebooks will be deployed throughout the district during the next few 
weeks in preparation for the Smarter Balanced assessment field test, which must 
be completed between April 7 and May 16, 2014.</p>
