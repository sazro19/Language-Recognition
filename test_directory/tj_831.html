<p>Ratings of the security risks associated with smartphone apps affect users' 
decisions whether to install those apps, but information about the safety of an 
app is more effective than information about its risks, according to researchers 
from <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">Purdue University</a>.</p>
<p>The report, "Effective Risk Communication for Android Apps," was published in 
the May-June issue of

Transactions on</a>

Dependable and Secure Computing</a>. The researchers examined the effects of 
including information about app permissions on users' decisions to install apps. 
They tested the effectiveness of including summary risk information and tested 
various methods of conveying that information to determine which approach was 
most effective.</p>
<p>Although most mobile systems have strong security measures in place, they 
often rely on users to make decisions that affect the security of the device, 
according to the authors. When users install apps, they may unwittingly 
give permission for malicious or intrusive apps to track their location and 
monitor their phone calls and text messages, including authentication messages 
used by secure sites. According to the researchers, users install these 
malicious apps without realizing the risks because they don't understand the 
permissions the app is requesting. </p>

<p>The researchers focused on the Android operating system, which includes more 
than 200 app permissions, many of which "do not make sense to the average user 
or at best require time and considerable mental effort to comprehend," according 
to information on the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/" target="_blank">National Science Foundation</a> 
 site, which funded the project. While users pay some attention to 
permissions, they also consider average ratings, number of downloads and user 
comments. Higher quality apps tend to get higher ratings, and users tend to 
submit comments about the security and privacy of an app. </p>
<p>Current app permissions are designed for the app developers, rather than the 
users, Ninghui Li, one of the researchers told NSF. Based on the results of 
their experiments, the researchers believe it would be more effective to display 
a risk score for each app because it would make the risk more obvious to users 
and provide an incentive for developers to reduce their use of personal 
information when developing apps. They also believe the inclusion of risk scores 
could increase user curiosity about security information and cause them to pay 
more attention to the warnings. </p>
<p>However, the researchers also found that people tend to pay more attention to 
safety information than risk information. The reason may be that users tend to 
base their decision to install an app on other positive information about it, 
such as the user ratings, number of downloads and user comments, so it follows 
that a positive safety rating is more compatible with the decision-making 
process than a negative risk rating.</p>
