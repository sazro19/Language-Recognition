<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> is donating 500 virtual reality kits to Arkansas schools under a first-of-its-kind partnership between the social media company and the state, according to the <a href="http://www.thestate.com/news/business/technology/article124800544.html" target="_blank">Associated Press</a>.</p>
<p>Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced the donation Thursday as part of the <a href="http://governor.arkansas.gov/press-releases/detail/gov.-hutchinson-and-facebook-announce-arkansas-facebook-techstart-partnersh" target="_blank">Arkansas Facebook and Techstart Partnership</a>, which is aimed at generating interest in computer science careers and instruction among students. The kits will include computers, cameras and the <a href="https://www3.oculus.com/en-us/rift/" target="_blank">Oculus Rift</a> headsets needed for the VR program. The value of the donation is estimated at $1 million, according to news reports.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, the VR kits will be distributed to approximately 250 schools, educational co-ops and STEM education centers. The donations will primarily target high schools with a high percentage of low-income students. </p>

<p>“Whenever (students) can touch the technology, can put it on and they can see the reality — the virtual reality — of what coding can do, that’s going to inspire a lot of students to say this is a future that I want to be involved in,” Hutchinson told reporters Thursday.</p>
