<p>A hacker going by the name "nclay" claims to have stolen more than 77 million user accounts from<a href="https://www.edmodo.com/" target="_blank"> Edmodo</a>, a K–12 social learning network of 78 million teachers, students, parents and other members, and has put the data for sale on the Dark Web,<a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/hacker-steals-millions-of-user-account-details-from-education-platform-edmodo" target="_blank"> <em>Motherboard</em> first reported</a>.</p>
<p>Breach notification site<a href="https://leakbase.pw/" target="_blank"> LeakBase</a> offered <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/page/about-motherboard" target="_blank"><em>Motherboard</em></a> a sample of more than 2 million records. The data revealed a mix of “usernames, e-mail addresses and hashed passwords,” which <em>Motherboard</em> verified by using a large, random data sample to try to create new Edmodo user accounts. “With every tested e-mail this was not possible because the address was already linked to an Edmodo account,” the news organization reported.</p>
