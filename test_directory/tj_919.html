<p><a href="http://www.oprfhs.org/" target="_blank">Oak Park and River Forest  High School</a> will adopt a warehouse solution to manage data, analytics and  reports.</p>
<p>The district has partnered with <a href="http://www.decisioned.com/" target="_blank">DecisionED</a>, whose solution uses the "<a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/analytics/cognos/" target="_blank">IBM Cognos</a> platform  for delivery of dashboards and reports," according to a news  release.</p>
<p>"We are excited about the ways in which the data  warehouse will accelerate and expand our ability to make meaning from the vast  amount of student data we collect," said Amy V. Hill, director of  assessment and research at the district, in a prepared statement. "We look  forward to the ways administrators and teachers will use the data warehouse  reports and features to more effectively identify and meet students' needs. We  also hope to put the tools to excellent use in analysis, decision-making, and  monitoring as we implement a new strategic plan."</p>
<p>Founded in 1873, Oak Park and River Forest High School is a  single-school district located nine miles from downtown Chicago. With a student  body of nearly 3,200students, the school boasts a graduation rate of more than  90 percent, according to information on its site.
