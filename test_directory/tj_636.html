<p><a href="http://www.registrationgateway.com/" target="_blank">SRC
Solutions</a> has added a complete portfolio of K-12
administrative software products that can be used in conjunction with
its
15-year-old Registration Gateway software.</p>
<p>The new <a href="http://www.registrationgateway.com/gatewaysuite-2" target="_blank">Gateway
suite</a> of workflow products range from software
that helps with student recruitment and continues with student
enrollment
, information management and even software that manages electronic parent
report
distribution. The components of the Gateway suite can be purchased all
at once
or singly, depending on a school district's needs and budget.</p>
<p>For instance, even if a school district is not in a
position
to acquire SRC's Registration Gateway, it can get its Address
Purification
Gateway, which is designed to help the district assure clean data in
preparation for future workflow enhancements.</p>
<p>Along with eight standalone applications, there are
six more
complimentary modules that may not be required by every school district,
such
as one application for athletics registration or another that can
geo-coordinate data analysis.</p>

<p>"Companies that offer single solutions are a dying
breed,"
said SRC Solutions CEO Patrick Maher. "Innovation, interoperability and
enhanced workflow design are key, and what we deliver with the Gateway
Suite."</p>
