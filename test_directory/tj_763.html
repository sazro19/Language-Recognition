<p>A new cloud platform is coming soon that caters specifically  to hosting education applications. Mainframe2 for Education, from <a href="https://www.mainframe2.com/" target="_blank">Mainframe2</a>, was introduced during <a href="http://www.tceaconvention.org/2015/" target="_blank">TCEA 2015</a>, a school technology  event hosted by the <a href="http://www.tcea.org/" target="_blank">Texas Computer Education  Association</a> in Austin this week.</p>
<p>The idea of Mainframe2, according to CEO Nikola Bozinovic,  is to allow schools to install software and configure it to run inside a  browser "within minutes." The applications are stored on  "powerful servers" in the cloud and deliver the user interface to the  browser as a video stream. Applications are administered and managed through a  Web-based interface. The service can also connect to third-party services, such  as <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> for cloud storage, so that  both applications and data reside online.</p>
<p>The company gives users choices for where their applications  are hosted based on geographical, technical or regulatory needs and uses data  centers run by Amazon, Microsoft and Google.</p>

<p>"Schools are already benefiting greatly from having  access to first-class Web apps, like Gmail," noted Bozinovic in a prepared  statement. "Our cloud platform extends this concept to thousands of  Windows apps. School IT admins can now deploy and manage all of their Windows  apps from one place, without an expensive data center to manage and cumbersome  VDI to operate. It's a huge barrier to broad adoption of inexpensive end  points, like Chromebooks, that we're eliminating today."</p>
<p>One site planning to test the service is an Ohio school  district. "We love Chromebooks, but ChromeOS doesn't run Windows programs.  We needed a way to deliver apps that don't run on Chrome and had been using <a href="http://www.citrix.com/" target="_blank">Citrix</a> in this role, but it couldn't satisfy  our needs," said Donald Clifton, technology coordinator with <a href="http://www.northwestern.k12.oh.us/" target="_blank">Northwestern Local Schools</a> in  Wooster. "When we heard about Mainframe2, it seemed like a great option to  provide Autodesk Inventor to our students."</p>
<p>Currently, the company is inviting districts to sign up for  an early access program. Additional versions of the service will be available  shortly for personal use, business and software vendors.</p>
