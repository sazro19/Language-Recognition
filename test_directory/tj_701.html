<p>Software development company <a href="http://airsquirrels.com">Squirrels</a> has upgraded its wireless screen-mirroring tool <a href="http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/">Reflector</a>. Formerly an AirPlay-only receiver, Reflector now accepts Google Cast connections from Android devices and Chromebooks, allowing teachers and students to wirelessly share their screens to a computer connected to a projector. </p>
<p>According to the company, students can mirror multiple screens at once from their iOS, Android and Chromebook screens to Reflector 2, directly from their desks. Teachers can use voiceover audio when recording any connected device to produce guides and materials for later student review, and can include multiple devices in one recording. </p>
<p>Several features are designed to keep students from sharing on the big screen without permission or from interrupting other presenters. Password protection puts the teacher in charge of who connects. Teachers can also allow or deny a device before it’s displayed, and onscreen codes only allow connections from students in a particular classroom. </p>

<p>Reflector 2 is a paid upgrade for current users. New users can purchase Reflector 2 for a one-time cost of $14.99. </p>
