<p>The <a href="http://www.cosn.org/" target="_blank">Consortium for School Networking</a>
(CoSN) and the <a href="http://www.titlei.org/" target="_blank">National Title I Association</a>
(NASTID) have developed a new toolkit for education technology leaders to help
them strengthen their relationship with District Title I directors and develop
successful educational technology initiatives.</p>
<p>The report, "Rethinking Equity in a Digital Era: Forging a Strong Partnership
Between District Title I and Technology Leaders," includes background on Title
I, a list of key factors for successful educational technology implementations,
a discussion guide for technology planning in Title I programs and tips for
improving collaboration between the Title I director and district chief
technology officer. The toolkit also includes case studies of three Title I
districts that have successfully implemented educational technology initiatives.</p>
<p>"Title I directors are responsible for helping schools reach all of their
students with a high quality education. Technology has become an essential tool
to make that happen," said Bob Harmon, CEO of NASTID, in a prepared statement.
"This toolkit will enable educational leaders, through connections to both Title
I and CoSN, to integrate best practices using more of the tools they need to
close the achievement gap."</p>
