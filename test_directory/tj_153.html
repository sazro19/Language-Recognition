<p>A group of  private and public organizations said that, for less than $20 billion, every  unserved rural school, library, health provider and community college in the  country that doesn't already have high-capacity broadband could get it and  share it out. In a <a href="http://shlb.org/uploads/Policy/Infrastructure/SHLB_ConnectingAnchors_CostEstimate.pdf" target="_blank">new study</a>, the <a href="http://www.shlb.org/" target="_blank">Schools,  Health &amp; Libraries Broadband (SHLB) Coalition</a> proposed that high-speed internet  be fed to these "anchor institutions," which could then act as  "middle-mile" providers to distribute the service to surrounding  users through a mix of wired and wireless technologies.</p>
<p>The report  comes on the heels of a Trump administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/building-stronger-america-president-donald-j-trumps-american-infrastructure-initiative/" target="_blank">infrastructure plan</a> that includes $50 billion set  aside for rural projects, distributed to states in the form of block grants,  and another $20 billion for unspecified "transformative projects";  both reference the possibility of increasing broadband facilities alongside  road, bridge, rail, port and water initiatives.</p>

<p>According  to the estimate, prepared for the coalition by public sector consultancy <a href="http://www.ctcnet.us/" target="_blank">CTC  Technology &amp; Energy</a>,  the cost of deploying fiber to all the "remaining anchor  institutions" — aside from those in Alaska — would run between $13 billion  and $19 billion. The cost would vary based on whether the deployment was done  in a "coordinated national effort" or handled in an "ad hoc  manner over a very long period." No matter how it was achieved, however,  the resulting infrastructure could provide broadband to 95 percent of the U.S.  population within the same zip code as the anchor institution.</p>
<p>The model  was developed by using federal government data that identifies the number of  U.S. anchors and then estimating how many of those currently lack fiber  connections. The country was divided into "into six standardized  geographic typologies" (such as metro, desert, plains, etc.), and average  costs to connect a single anchor within each typology were calculated. Expenses  covered extending fiber from a central office, hub or backbone fiber  interconnection point; entering the building; and installing the network  components. For example, the average cost to connect an anchor in a rural  western site ranged from a low of $56,000 to a high of $81,000, whereas doing  so in a rural eastern location would be between $75,000 and $112,000.</p>

<p>If  appropriate funding were found and those construction efforts were coordinated  among state and regional authorities, the proposal asserted, a savings of up to  50 percent would be possible.</p>
<p>The report  stated that the deployment costs could be reduced by using an open application  process that would allow both commercial and non-commercial providers to bid.  It also suggested that broadband infrastructure be opened to  "interconnection," allowing existing infrastructure "to be used  rather than building out additional, duplicative infrastructure."</p>
<p>"Now  is the time to act. At least 19 million people still lack access to adequate  broadband in rural areas," said John Windhausen, Jr., executive director  of the SHLB Coalition, in a prepared statement. "Deploying high-capacity  broadband to and through community anchor institutions to their communities is  a proven and successful strategy."</p>
