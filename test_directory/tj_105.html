<p><a href="https://www.kajeet.net/" target="_blank">Kajeet</a> is announcing improvements to its<a href="https://www.kajeet.net/smartbus" target="_blank"> SmartBus</a> offerings to create a fully connected bus for school districts. These enhancements include push to talk headsets, a camera offload function and intelligent sensors.</p>
<p>The PTT headsets will improve communications between the dispatch and school bus drivers. Camera offload enables the automatic download of video camera data from DVRs in order to save time for school districts that want to view and address school bus incidents. Intelligent sensors will provide transportation administrators with real time notifications of events taking place on school buses in their fleets through a system of automated alerts.</p>

<p>"Kajeet is thrilled to announce the expansion of our current Kajeet SmartBus offering to provide additional technology helping keep students and drivers safe, by connecting the bus to their transportation teams," said Kajeet CEO and founder Daniel Neal. "The Connected Bus is the idea of a completely connected school bus, bringing these vehicles into the future to ensure Dispatch is in the loop even when they're not on the bus." </p>
