<p>Some schools might have a problem on their hands when it  comes to the use of educational technology and the need to protect student  privacy, according to <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/media/2018/180913.aspx" target="_blank">an alert</a> issued by <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/" target="_blank">the Federal Bureau of  Investigation</a>. The alert  warns schools that the widespread collection of student data could have privacy  and safety implications if the information is compromised or exploited. </p>
<p>The FBI recommends the following for parents and families:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research existing student and child privacy  protections of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, the Protection of  Pupil Rights Amendment, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and state  laws that apply to educational technology services.</li>
<li>Discuss with their local districts about what  and how educational technologies and programs are used in their classrooms.</li>
<li>Conduct research on parent coalition and  information-sharing organizations who can provide support and additional resources.</li>
<li>Research school-related cyber breaches, which can  inform families of student data vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Consider credit and theft monitoring to check  for any fraudulent use of their children's identity.</li>
<li>Conduct regular internet searches of children's  information to help identify exposures and limit the spread of information on  the internet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Multiple attacks on school information technology systems  occurred in 2017 through  actors hacking into multiple school district  servers, according to the FBI. Student  contact information, education plans, homework assignments, medical records and  counselor reports were stolen, and then the thieves used that information to  contact, extort and threaten students with the release of their personal  information.</p>
<p>As a result of these attacks, the Department of Education  issued a <a href="https://ifap.ed.gov/eannouncements/101617ALERTCyberAdvisoryNewTypeCyberExtortionThreat.html" target="_blank">CyberAdvisory  alert</a> in October 2017 to encourage IT staff at schools and districts  to protect their systems through security audits, training staff and students  on best practices and reviewing all sensitive data to maintain proper  controls.  </p>
<p>Parents with evidence of their children's data being  compromised should <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank">contact the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center here</a>.</p>
