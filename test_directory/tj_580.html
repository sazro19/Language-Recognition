<p>An organization that monitors Internet connectivity to  schools has reported that while 20 million additional students have been given  access to high-speed Internet, a comparably high number "still don't have  the speeds they need."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.educationsuperhighway.org/" target="_blank">EducationSuperHighway's</a> 2015 "<a href="http://stateofthestates.educationsuperhighway.org/" target="_blank">State  of the States</a>" report has found that more than three-quarters of  school districts (77 percent) meet the widely accepted goal of 100 Kbps per  student. That count was only 30 percent in 2013. The remaining 23 percent of  districts leave 21 million students lacking the connectivity required for  digital learning.</p>
<p>Even when that remaining gap is filled, however, the job won't  be done, the report warned, because the target is moving. The connectivity standards  established by the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Communications  Commission</a> (FCC) (originally proposed by the <a href="http://www.setda.org/" target="_blank">State  Education Technology Directors Association</a>) have two levels. The first is  Internet access of 100 Mbps per 1,000 users (that 100 Kbps-per-student goal).  The second is access of 1 Gbps per 1,000 users or a megabit per second per  student, which the "vast majority" of school districts haven't yet  put in place, according to EducationSuperHighway.</p>

<p>School districts meeting connectivity goals pay less for  Internet access. Figure taken from "<a href="http://stateofthestates.educationsuperhighway.org/" target="_blank">2015 State of the  States</a>" report by EducationSuperHighway.</p>
</div>
<p>Calling states "critical actors" in the job of  improving broadband access for their students, the organization intends to  monitor state-by-state progress toward achieving connectivity goals and issue annual  reports. The analysis is being done on data filed with the FCC's <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/universal-service-program-schools-and-libraries-e-rate" target="_blank">Universal  Service Program for Schools and Libraries</a>, otherwise known as E-rate. In  2014, the FCC made all E-rate application data open for the first time, which  EducationSuperHighway used as the starting point for its latest work.</p>
<p>Much of the gain made between 2013 and 2015, the researchers  found, is due to a decline in the median cost of Internet access, which shrunk  from $22 per Mbps in 2013 to $11 per Mbps in 2015. The report noted that for  those districts meeting the 100 kbps per student goal, the average cost per  megabit is $5.07; within those districts not meeting the goal, the average cost  was more than double: $12.33. Similarly, the first group has double the annual  budget per student for Internet access compared to the second group: $4.93 vs.  $2.08.</p>
<p>To "finish" the job of connecting students in the  United States to the Internet appropriately, the organization's researchers  offered three broad recommendations for governors:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, to provide every school with access to  fiber. According to the researchers, 12 percent of schools still lack any access  to fiber. As the report noted, state leaders "have a three-year window to  take advantage of E-rate funding to build fiber connections to schools that do  not currently have it and help school districts obtain the infrastructure they  need by providing technical and procurement support."</li>
<li>Second, to put Wi-Fi into every classroom.  That's a major goal of the E-rate modernization program, which is providing $1  billion per year in funding over five years. State leaders can help spend that  money wisely by making sure school personnel are educated on "Wi-Fi  procurement best practices" and have access to consortia purchasing  programs that lower costs.</li>
<li>Third, to make broadband affordable. This is the  number one obstacle, the report said, to schools meeting the FCC's lower tier  of connectivity goals let alone keeping up with the expected 50  percent-per-year growth in broadband demand. Governors can take a role, the  researchers advised, in promoting consortia purchasing of broadband, protecting  price transparency and pushing for state subsidy programs.</li>
