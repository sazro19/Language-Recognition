<p><a href="http://www.atlantiscomputing.com/" target="_blank">Atlantis Computing</a>, a 
developer of software-defined storage solutions, has released
<a href="http://www.atlantiscomputing.com/products/usx" target="_blank">Atlantis ILIO USX</a> 
(unified software-defined storage), which is designed for virtualized server 
workloads.</p>
<p>According to the company, Atlantis ILIO USX lets IT departments pool their 
existing and disparate storage solutions and share the storage between 
applications. The software works with storage area network (SAN), 
network-attached storage (NAS), RAM and flash memory as well as solid state, SAS 
and SATA drives and older storage arrays. The company claims the solution 
enables organizations to deploy up to five times more virtual machines (VMs) by 
optimizing their existing storage to suit the needs of their applications.</p>
<p>Atlantis ILIO USX is intended to eliminate storage silos by unifying the 
various storage types and making them available to all applications. Once the IT 
department has consolidated storage, they can then use the solution's 
policy-based controls to "optimize capacity, availability and performance based 
on application needs, resulting in lower storage costs and better VM 
performance," according to information from the company. Atlantis ILIO USX also 
offers data services including high availability, data protection, inline data 
deduplication, compression and thin provisioning.</p>

<p>"Software-defined storage will dramatically increase the efficiency of all 
datacenter storage, allowing IT organizations to get more out of their existing 
storage and moving forward," said Torsten Volk, research director for Enterprise 
Management Associates, in a prepared statement.  It also gives organizations 
"the flexibility to transform commodity hardware into enterprise-class storage," 
he added.</p>
<p>Atlantis ILIO USX is available now. Further information about the solution is 
available on the <a href="http://www.atlantiscomputing.com/products/usx" target="_blank">
