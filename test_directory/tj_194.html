<p>About 70 percent of high school teachers assign homework that requires some online activity, yet millions of families in the U.S. with school-age children lack internet access at home. For the 2017-2018 school year, <a href="https://www.sprint.com/" target="_blank">Sprint</a> launched a nationwide campaign aimed at closing the <a href="http://neatoday.org/2016/04/20/the-homework-gap/" target="_blank">homework gap</a> for these students. </p>
<p>Through Sprint’s <a href="http://goodworks.sprint.com/1millionproject/index.cfm" target="_blank">1Million Project</a>, the company has ambitiously committed to providing 1 million high school students living in low-income households with free and connected smartphones, tablets and hotspot devices.</p>

<p>The 1Million Project began last year, when <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/12/15/sprint-starts-filling-in-digital-divide-at-11-schools.aspx" target="_blank">Sprint piloted the project across 11 cities</a> and distributed devices to 4,000 students.</p>
