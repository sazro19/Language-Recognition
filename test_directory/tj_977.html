<p><a href="http://www.spencertech.org/" target="_blank">Spencer Elementary Technology Academy</a>,
one of five technology academies within <a href="http://www.cps.edu/" target="_blank">Chicago
Public Schools</a>, has updated its computer labs with refurbished Apple
computers.</p>
<p>The computers in the school's labs had become outdated, so the school
leadership looked at the available replacement options. Since the school
operates within a limited budget, purchasing new Apple computers was out of the
question. Ultimately, they decided on refurbished machines from
<a href="http://www.mactoschool.com/" target="_blank">Mac to School</a>.</p>
<p>Mac to School is a company that buys, sells and refurbishes Apple computers
and equipment for the K-12 education market. According to the company, by buying
refurbished tech from Mac to School, Spencer Technology Academy was able to save
more than 50 percent of the purchase cost than if they had purchased directly
from Apple. </p>
<p>Mac to School sells refurbished MacBooks, Mac desktops, iPads and Apple
accessories. The company also purchases used equipment from schools that want to
upgrade their equipment or or offset the cost of new equipment.</p>

<p>According to Tracey Howse, lead technology teacher, the school places high
priority on providing students with "high quality educational technology to
facilitate their learning," and the school was so impressed with the quality,
service and prices from Mac to School that they have placed multiple orders with
them since their initial computer lab upgrade.</p>
<p>According to the school's site, Spencer Elementary Technology Academy focuses
on math, science and reading education, "while utilizing technology and real
life experiences as the means to enhance classroom instruction." The magnet
school serves more than 700 students in grades preK-8. </p>
