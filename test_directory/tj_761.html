<p>Alabama's <a href="http://www.shelbyed.k12.al.us/index.htm" target="_blank">Shelby County Schools</a> are  adopting Chromebooks and iPads in an effort to beef up technology options after  upgrading its computer labs last year.</p>
<p>The 31-school district will  provide 30 iPad Minis to each school with grades K-3 and 30 14-inch Chromebooks  to all other schools. In total, the project comprises 140 iPads and 713  Chromebooks for a total cost of approximately $280,000.</p>
<p>Chromebooks were chosen for  schools with older students to give them opportunities to work on keyboards and  because they were more popular among students and staff than other laptops or  notebooks.</p>
<p>"The feedback has been overwhelming,"  said Susan Poling, district technology coordinator, in <a href="http://www.shelbycountyreporter.com/2015/02/06/shelby-county-schools-upgrading-technology/" target="_blank">a  story about the initiative</a> for the Shelby County Reporter. "Our  students and teachers like the Chromebooks better because they start up faster,  hold battery life longer, are lighter weight, and let every student easily log  into their account."</p>
