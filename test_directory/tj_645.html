<p><a href="http://harmonytx.org/default.aspx" target="_blank">Harmony Public Schools</a> is adopting new human resources software in an
effort to standardize across 43 schools.</p>
<p>The organization, with 28,500 students in K-12 college preparatory schools throughout Texas, has selected
<a href="http://www.ptsteams.com/products.php" target="_blank">Teams</a>, from <a href="http://www.ptsteams.com/" target="_blank">Prologic
technology Systems</a>, to replace its "current system and service provider support with a robust, completely automated electronic workflow
linking human resources, time and attendance, employee self-service portal and substitute management," according to a news release.</p>
<p>"Harmony Public Schools made the decision to sign with Teams because we were very impressed with its structure," said Darren Polat, chief
talent officer for Harmony, in a news release. "It truly is an integrated tool, and has allowed us to combine and consolidate; where we use to
need three different programs to complete a task, we now only need one."</p>
<p>"Many of the features offered by TEAMS appealed to the Harmony team," added Polat, "but what spoke to us most about the TEAMS software was
the position inventory feature. With a number of newly implemented guidelines at the campus level, this allows us to make sure those are
implemented as well as know the budgetary impacts, etc. TEAMS' software also allows us to be completely electronic and eliminate the need for
paper records altogether."</p>
