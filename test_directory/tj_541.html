<p>The <a href="http://www.pvbears.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1" target="_blank">Pleasant Valley School  District</a> (PVSD) has teamed with a private partner to ease student  registration and human resources onboarding.</p>
<p>The district partnered with SRC Solutions to adopt the  company's <a href="http://registrationgateway.com/" target="_blank">Registration Gateway</a> and <a href="http://registrationgateway.com/products/human-resources-gateway/" target="_blank">Human  Resources Gateway</a> products. With Registration Gateway, parents can now  enter student data via an automated and auto-corrected process designed to save  time. Upon completion, registrars at PVSD simply review and approve the information,  which is then sent to the district's SunGard eSchoolPlus student information  system.</p>
<p>"All parents must register with Online Enrollment. The  parents either complete the registration information online before arriving at  the registration office or they complete this part of the process at a work  station located in the registration office prior to seeing the registration  secretary," said  Carole Geary, superintendent at PVSD, in a prepared  statement. "This also allows us to serve more people on a given day making  the process more timely for staff and convenient for parents."</p>

<p>The new HR tool "has improved the process of human  resource management for Pleasant Valley School District in a way very similar  to that of the student registration process," according to a news release.  "HR Gateway by SRC Solutions is a paperless, configurable, web-based  portal that streamlines the intake of data as well as the retention and  distribution of documents related to onboarding new employees. By collecting  and storing employee information digitally, HR Gateway creates a streamlined  office environment where storage, file access and security problems are things  of the past."</p>
