<p>IT spending by K-12 in the United States is expected to hit about $4.7 billion for 2015. The biggest single area for technology spending
will be laptop computers at $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Those estimates come out of a new <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=GI255747" target="_blank">IT spending pivot table</a>
from <a href="http://www.idc.com/prodserv/insights/government/index.jsp" target="_blank">IDC Government Insights</a>, which provides estimates
and forecasts for the entire U.S. education sector, encompassing K–12, higher ed and "other" education. According to the analyst firm, the
guidance will be published bi-annually. The report will include details on education level, individual states, education functional areas,
enrollment levels and technology segments.</p>
<p>The current spending guide also offered these findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>California leads in overall education IT spending at $2.3 billion for 2015, followed by Texas ($1.2 billion) and New York
    ($1.1 billion);</li>
<li>Tablets and e-readers will grow by eight percent across all education levels and types by the end of 2015, for a total of $522 million.
    Spending for that category in K-12 will reach $153 million, about 29 percent of the total, an upswing driven, according to Research Director
    Shawn McCarthy, by "classroom use"; and</li>
<li>Spending on notebook computers peaked in 2014 at just over $4 billion across all education levels and types. That's expected to decline by
    nearly seven percent this year.</li>
</ul>

<p>"IT growth among educational institutions has been spurred by a recovering economy, recovering tax bases, and an increase in the number of
government education grants," said McCarthy. "While the drop in PC spending was a bit surprising last year, we expect tablet computers to have
a bright future in education, particularly for use in science classes and for one-off training via apps."</p>
