<p>Two Texas school systems have recently adopted online student information system (SIS) <a href="http://www.skyward.com/">Skyward</a>. <a href="http://www.mesquiteisd.org/home/"><strong>Mesquite Independent School District</strong></a> chose the application based on its reputation among other Texas schools. Charter school <a href="http://www.villagetechschools.org/"><strong>Village Tech Schools</strong></a> selected it to improve communications and other operations.</p>
<p>Mesquite will start using Skyward's <a href="http://www.skyward.com/K-12/Student-Management-Suite.aspx">Student Management Suite</a> in the fall of 2016 to improve data integration, according to a prepared statement from Denise Kutch, Mesquite's assistant superintendent. Other buying criteria included data accuracy and security of student data, usability of the software and data storage capabilities. And, Kutch added, "Skyward's reputation within the state of Texas is impeccable." </p>
<p>Village Tech adopted the same suite as well as the company's <a href="http://www.skyward.com/K-12/School-Business-Suite.aspx">School Business Suite</a>, which provides functionality for human resources, payroll and accounting, and staff and asset management. In his statement, Village Tech Chief Technology Officer Jeremy Jameson said,  "Skyward brings everything under one roof; it's a one-stop shop for grading, scheduling, communicating with parents and managing business operations such as payroll and inventory. Having the option to bring the student and business systems together will help our district move forward, so we don't have to constantly keep cross-referencing data." The school system deployed the student management suite last spring and is currently implementing the business suite.</p>
