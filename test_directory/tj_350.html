<p>While 2016 was a bad year for smartphones — seeing just 2.5 percent year-over-year growth for the devices — this year things are looking up. Overall, worldwide smartphone shipments are expected to rebound with single-digit growth. Android devices will comprise a majority share (85 percent) of the smartphone market, followed by Apple (14.7 percent) and Microsoft in third place (0.1 percent). </p>
<p>Those are the latest predictions from technology research firm <a href="http://www.idc.com/" target="_blank">International Data Corporation</a> (IDC). Based on its <a href="http://www.idc.com/tracker/showproductinfo.jsp?prod_id=37" target="_blank">Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker</a>, IDC forecasts shipment volumes to grow 4.2 percent in 2017 and 4.4 percent in 2018, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.8 percent over the 2016-2021 forecast. Smartphone shipments are forecast to reach 1.53 billion units in 2017, growing to 1.77 billion in 2021.</p>

<p>As for specific platforms, IDC doesn't expect much change throughout the forecast period: Android will still dominate the smartphone market, with shipment volumes reaching 1.35 billion units in 2017. Although Android growth will gradually decline during the forecast period, IDC does not yet expect shipments to contract year-over-year “given the demand for new features such as augmented and virtual reality,” according an IDC statement. </p>
<p>The biggest Android markets driving volume continue to be the Middle East &amp; Africa; Central &amp; Eastern Europe; and Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan). While the average selling price in these markets ranges from $150 to $200, more mature markets like North America and Western Europe see twice that price range, “which is a big reason many device OEMs are launching flagship models in these markets first,” according to IDC. Additionally, IDC expects phones with displays of five inches and greater to grow from 75 percent of Android shipments in 2016 to 91 percent in 2021.</p>
