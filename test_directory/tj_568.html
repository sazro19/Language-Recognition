<p>MySurveillix runs an alerting feature that delivers alerts  by text or email when it finds something amiss, such as a camera dropping off  the system or no longer recording correctly. The second component of  MySurveillix is automated reporting, which provides customers with a daily,  weekly or monthly report that has snapshots of all of the cameras on their  systems to allow the security administrator to make sure the system is up and  running, all cameras are connected and all cameras are in focus and providing a  good image day and night.</p>
<p>While the warranty period runs for a year and includes  engineer support, the education package provides software updates and upgrades  of MySurveillix and other software for the life of the recorder.</p>
<p>Education discounts run between 10 and 15 percent, according  to Greg Hartzell, director of Toshiba Surveillance &amp; IP Video Products. He  added that the actual discount would depend on the size of the project and the  pricing provided by Toshiba's resellers.</p>
<p>"The threat of violence, vandalism and burglary are a  reality in today's schools, as are reduced budgets for security," noted Hartzell.  The new program "is crafted to overcome budget constraints. It offers  institutions far more than just special pricing on Toshiba cameras,  accessories, software and recorders; it is a complete solution including long-term  benefits aimed at providing committed support and controlling total cost of  ownership."</p>
