<p>Educators overseeing Chromebook programs have a new tool to  help them manage those devices. <a href="http://www.lightspeedsystems.com/" target="_blank">Lightspeed  Systems</a> has unveiled the <a href="http://www.lightspeedsystems.com/products/bundles/chrome-bundle/" target="_blank">Bundle  for Chrome</a>. The company also introduced a new cloud filter for schools to  ensure CIPA compliance. Both announcements came during the <a href="https://conference.iste.org/2016/" target="_blank">International Society for Technology  in Education 2016 Conference</a>, taking place this week in Denver.</p>
<p>The Chrome release provides features to educators for  classroom controls and to IT people for device security. A bundled version of  the new release pulls together two of Lightspeed's products: <a href="http://www.lightspeedsystems.com/products/web-filter/" target="_blank">Web Filter</a> and <a href="http://www.lightspeedsystems.com/products/classroom-orchestrator/" target="_blank">Classroom  Orchestrator</a>. The first program ensures that students are protected from  inappropriate content on websites, in compliance with the federal <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act" target="_blank">Children's  Internet Protection Act</a>. Besides providing CIPA help, Web Filter also  offers management and security functionality, such as the ability to delegate  administrator roles, impose online testing policies and perform blocking of  malware and peer-to-peer activity. The second product in the bundle, the  Classroom Orchestrator, helps teachers maintain control over student devices.</p>
