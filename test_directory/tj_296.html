<p>The PreK–12 professional learning, or development, market is estimated at $5.3 billion through 2020-2021, according to a recent <a href="http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/q8m4lv/prek12" target="_blank">report</a> by market research firm <a href="http://www.researchandmarkets.com" target="_blank">Research and Markets</a>.</p>
<p>The report, “<a href="http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/q8m4lv/prek12" target="_blank">PreK–12 Professional Learning Market 2016</a>,” examines the PD segment for teachers, administrators and other educators. It includes analysis of per-teacher spending and market growth projections. The focus is on factors influencing change in the market, challenges facing the sector and the forces driving demand, both currently and in the coming years, according to a news release.</p>
<p>The report was developed through reporting by editors and is not based on a survey, Research and Markets said. Providers of PD for the PreK–12 market and educators at schools, districts and states were interviewed and best practices research was reviewed. The information in the report is based on research that included federal, state and local funding and spending data.</p>
