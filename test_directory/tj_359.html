<p>Digital technology is helping educators re-conceive teaching and learning in new and intriguing ways, and schools around the world are experiencing a transformation with tech’s use in the classroom.</p>
<p>The annual <a href="http://www.digitallearningday.org/">Digital Learning Day</a>, started in 2012, gives educators an opportunity to collaborate with peers, share ideas, try out new digital tools, celebrate education innovation and play a role in the transformation of their own schools and communities.</p>
<p>Digital Learning Day 2017 is Thursday, Feb. 23. Here are some resources and ideas for celebrating the day:</p>
<ul>
