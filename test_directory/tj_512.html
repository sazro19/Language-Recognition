<p>Two school systems have gone public with their use of firewall  appliances to implement content filtering software and wireless access points. <a href="http://www.franklin.k12.al.us/" target="_blank">Franklin County Schools</a> in Alabama  and <a href="http://www.chester-nj.org/index.cfm" target="_blank">Chester School District</a> in New Jersey are both using appliances from the Seattle-based <a href="http://www.watchguard.com/" target="_blank">WatchGuard Technologies</a>, which sells  firewalls, access points and other security products.</p>
<p>The Alabama district has been using WatchGuard products  since 2000. Franklin County's current firewall is an <a href="http://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-products/ngfw/xtm-1500/overview" target="_blank">XTM  1525-RP</a>, which has 25 Gbps firewall throughput and 10 Gbps virtual private  network throughput. On top of that the school system has added a subscription  to WatchGuard's security suite, which offers gateway antivirus, spam blocking,  web blocking, intrusion prevention and application control. The district also  has deployed <a href="http://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-products/secure-wireless/access-points/overview" target="_blank">AP200</a> wireless access points, supporting 802.11a/b/g/n in its seven locations. To  serve residents in its rural area, the district also runs a couple of access  points on the edge of its school grounds to provide "guest" Wi-Fi  access.</p>

<p>"The school board can't afford to hire a huge staff, so  it's essential to have a system and appliances that are easily manageable, and  that's what WatchGuard does for us," noted Tim Burks, network  administrator at Franklin County's district, in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>Chester School District has about 1,200 students and 400  staff members. After an evaluation of solutions from a handful of network  providers, the school system chose WatchGuard's XTM 850, with 8 Gbps firewall  and virtual private network throughput. That's armed with application control,  web filtering, spam blocking, gateway antivirus and intrusion prevention.  Shortly after deployment, the system helped IT staff catch students attempting  to go onto disallowed websites. With the use of Active Directory authentication  and WatchGuard reporting tools, IT was able to identify the responsible  students and forwarded that information to the administration for follow-up.</p>
<p>"The ease of access to information and the intuitive  platform provided by WatchGuard has freed up valuable time that, in the past,  was spent monitoring and maintaining the previous device," said Dean  Anderson, Chester's technology director, in a press release. "Now, more  time can be spent where it matters — supporting the staff and students."</p>
