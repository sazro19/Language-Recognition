<p>Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) is introducing<a href="https://www.tomudall.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/S%20738%20School%20Bus%20WiFi.pdf"> legislation</a> to make changes to the Federal Communications  Commission's <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/e-rate-schools-libraries-usf-program">E-rate  program</a> to reimburse school districts who put WiFi on school buses.  The E-rate program is the FCC's program to help schools and libraries obtain affordable  broadband services under the Universal Service Administrative Company.</p>
<p>"It's time to end the homework gap and set our kids up for  success. By extending internet access to students while they commute to and  from school, this bill would turn travel time into study time, enabling kids to  complete their homework before they get home," said Udall. "As a member of the  Senate Commerce Committee, I'll continue to push for innovative,  21st century solutions to help bridge the digital divide that hurts too  many rural, tribal, and low-income communities across New Mexico through strong  federal investment in broadband and internet infrastructure." </p>

<p>CoSN CEO Keith Krueger expressed his support for the bill as  part of an effort to help students from low-income families gain access to WiFi  connectivity.</p>
<p>"E-rate funding has helped school leaders invest in  technology infrastructure and upgrade their learning environments," said  Krueger.  "The forward-looking proposal  introduced by the bipartisan group of senators would take the program to the  next level and strengthen its impact across America."</p>
