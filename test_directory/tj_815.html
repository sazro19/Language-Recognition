<p>Teachers jump onto free online education services like Costco members at sample stands  —  continually trolling for something that's new and different and worth the investment. But the moment they start adding student information, such as name and contact information, they could be breaking federal laws. In this two-part series, Attorney Bret Cohen covers the basics of what schools, districts and teachers should understand about the use of student data for educational purposes.</p>
<p>Cohen practices as an associate in the areas of privacy, cybersecurity, antitrust and consumer protection for <a href="http://www.hoganlovells.com/" target="_blank">Hogan Lovells</a>, an international legal practice that has worked with both school districts and service providers that cater to education. In March the law firm issued <a href="http://ehoganlovells.com/rv/ff001600253a0bc3c89689e41d42a1d24dacddd4" target="_blank">an alert about education and privacy</a> to explain a February <a href="http://ptac.ed.gov/sites/default/files/Student%20Privacy%20and%20Online%20Educational%20Services%20%28February%202014%29.pdf" target="_blank">guidance document from the Department of Education</a> on how to protect student privacy while using online educational services. Cohen will be speaking in a panel at <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/41349" target="_blank">SXSWedu 2015</a> on the same topic.</p>

<p><strong>Dian Schaffhauser: We're talking about the outsourcing of certain educational services where there's student data generated and maintained. What regulations come into play here on a federal level?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bret Cohen: </strong>On a federal level the primary regulations are [<a href="http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html" target="_blank">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</a>] and <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ppra/index.html" target="_blank">Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA)</a>. These laws were adopted a while ago and weren't designed in our modern interconnected ecosystem, where data can be stored in the cloud and processed rapidly. A lot of the difficulties that [we] see are based on an inability to translate older law into a modern context.</p>
<p>The general requirement of FERPA is that schools are not allowed to disclose the personally identifiable information of students, which is broadly defined, without parental consent or, if the student is [18 or older], without the consent of the student. This is the general rule. So you can see how this would limit the use of service providers.</p>
<p>But there are some exceptions, the primary one being that certain third-parties can be deemed "school officials" subject to an exception to the rule prohibiting the disclosure of this information if they perform an institutional service or function and are under the direct control of the school or district.</p>
<p>This was not something envisioned for third party electronic service providers when the laws were first written. But they've been shoe-horned into this exception.</p>
<p><strong>Schaffhauser: What kind of data are we talking about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cohen: </strong>We're talking about education records. This is pretty broadly defined [as] almost anything that a school stores about its students, and it can include just their name and contact information. There are separate exceptions to that for directory information, but in theory all of that information is protected under FERPA</p>
<p><strong>Schaffhauser: When does a district or school know that it needs to pay attention to these regulations?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cohen: </strong>Any time that it gives access to its systems to a vendor or that it transfers information to a vendor to do some sort of procedure on its behalf, it should raise the red flag to look at this as an issue that might be subject to FERPA.</p>
<p><strong>Schaffhauser: Let's start with teachers. They have access to these great online services that are often free to use. What do teachers need to understand these data privacy rules in regards to that kind of usage?</strong></p>
