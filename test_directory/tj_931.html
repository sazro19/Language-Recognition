<p>A new report from the Consortium for School Networking (CoSN) looks at how schools are best managing their budgets under financial pressures. Intended as a resource for district and technology leaders, the report examines saving money through demonstrating ROI, sustainable technology practices, and good financial leadership.</p>
<p>The report is released as part of CoSN’s <a href="http://cosn.org/smartit" target="_blank">Smart IT initiative</a>, which focuses on technology planning and management, and sponsored by Amplify, HP, Lenovo, and Sprint. </p>
<p>Specifically the paper examines the following elements IT leaders should consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to calculate value of investment (VOI) and total cost of ownership (TCO) instead of only ROI;</li>
<li>Whether a green computing strategy, and an overall reduction of a school system’s carbon emissions, can save money;</li>
<li>How to build relationships between CTOs and CFOs and other financial leaders;</li>
<li>5 tips to follow, from improving security and bandwidth to strengthening leadership skills, in the coming year. </li>
</ul>

<p>"District technology leaders continue to face an uphill battle in receiving adequate IT funding to meet school needs. Today’s tight budgets force school systems to operate with a near-term outlook, rather than developing long-term technology solutions," said Keith Krueger, CEO of CoSN in a statement. </p>
<p>"Despite the circumstances, school technology leaders can strategically maximize their investment opportunities. Capturing current leading insight and expertise, supplemented by leading-edge tools, this new paper guides school technology leaders in that direction, so they can make the most of their dollars to improve education outcomes."</p>
