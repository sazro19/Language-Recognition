<p><a href="http://www.filewave.com">FileWave</a> has introduced version 8.0 of its mobile device management software. New features include Android support, the addition of inventory-based smart groups, VPP managed distribution for Mac with multiple sToken support, parameterized profiles for Mac and advanced license management. </p>
<p><strong>Android Support</strong><br/>
FileWave 8.0 now adds Android to its supported client operating systems, joining OS X, Windows and iOS. Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enrollment and management of Android devices (v4.1 and higher)</li>
<li>Application and content deployment (APKs, PDFs, etc.)</li>
<li>Timed deployments to push or remove content at specified times</li>
<li>Self-service end user kiosk for on-demand content</li>
<li>Self-healing deployments to reduce down time</li>
<li>Integrated inventory</li>
<li>Remote wipe</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inventory-Based Smart Groups</strong><br/>
FileWave administrators can now create inventory-based smart groups and build rule-based deployment scenarios. Specific computers and devices can be identified by a range of admin-defined variables to automatically group devices, ensuring that any machine that matches the smart group, now and in the future, will automatically get the prescribed fileset(s). </p>

<p><strong>Managed Distribution for Mac</strong><br/>
FileWave 8.0 extends VPP managed distribution to OS X devices. With license management, users can now include applications from the Apple App Store in the license management tab, so a view of iOS/Mac app store and standard fileset-based licenses is accessible in one place. Licenses can now be assigned and revoked for Mac apps. Via FileWave's self-service kiosk, end users can obtain a licenses themselves.</p>
<p>With the addition of multiple sToken support, FileWave 8.0 enables institutions to have multiple facilitators manage software deployments and gather all purchasing agents in one spot. With the system's tiered administration capability, FileWave administrators can create custom filesets; maintain control over which iOS or OS X systems they can distribute to; and provide granular support to all levels of an organization. If an organization uses Apple's Volume Purchase Program, FileWave's multiple sToken support will streamline institutional purchasing processes.</p>
<p><strong>Coming Soon: Support for Apple's Device Enrollment Program</strong><br/>
FileWave will soon add support for Apple's Device Enrollment Program (DEP). Clients will be able to pre-enroll iOS devices that are purchased directly from Apple into their FileWave management system. This new functionality will allow IT organizations to supervise devices over the air, disallow removal of the MDM profile and provide customized enrollment, per device, right out of the box. </p>
