<p><a href="http://www.dukeschool.org/page" target="_blank">Duke School</a>, an  independent, preK-8, project-based school in Durham, NC, has updated its data  storage infrastructure in an effort to deliver storage services to students and  staff.</p>
<p>The school's IT team eventually selected <a href="http://www.cohodata.com/" target="_blank">Coho DataStream</a> for its scalability and its  ability to analyze performance issues around virtual machines (VMs).</p>
<p>"We wanted to replace our aging legacy array in its  virtual environment," said Brian Horton, director of technology,  operations and innovations at Duke School, in a prepared statement. "The  complexity of the traditional storage systems made it difficult to analyze  performance issues related to VMs. We evaluated several other storage  solutions, but were ultimately impressed that the Coho system was racked and  configured in less than 30 minutes — all through a cost effective solution."</p>
<p>The new platform offers "a single pane of glass that  provides high levels of performance and granular VM visibility not possible  with traditional LUN-based approaches," according to a news release. "The  result is a platform that is simple to manage with little or no maintenance  required."</p>

<p>"We really appreciate working with knowledgeable  organizations like Duke School's IT team, as they clearly understand what their  specific needs are when it comes to seeking a modern scale-out storage solution  that is flexible and will grow as the school continues to move forward as an  innovative educational institution in the new millennium," said Suzy  Visvanathan, director of product management at Coho Data, in a prepared  statement.</p>
