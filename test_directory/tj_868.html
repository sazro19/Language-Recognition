<p>Forty percent  of all devices worn on the wrist will be smartwatches by 2016, according to a  new report from market research firm <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/home.jsp" target="_blank">Gartner</a>. That prediction  follows a swell in the smartwatches available to consumers as the number of  companies offering the devices has increased from just two a year ago to seven  with a device either currently on the market or about to ship.</p>
<p>"Apple has finally unveiled its Apple Watch, which we  expect to trigger more consumer interest once it starts shipping in 2015,"  said Angela McIntyre, research director at Gartner, in a prepared statement. "Apple  introduced three smartwatch models that will sell at a wide price range, with  the lowest starting at $349. As with the iPhone, Apple's high-price strategy  for the Watch will limit its market share; yet, with its attention to design  and the user interface, we believe this product will attract many users." </p>
<p>Early products, such as  the <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/us/products/accessories/smartwatch/" target="_blank">Sony  SmartWatch</a> and <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/wearable-tech" target="_blank">Samsung  Gear</a>, generated little "enthusiasm from consumers due to their  unclear value proposition and flawed design," said Annette Zimmermann,  research director at Gartner, in a news release. "In 2014 we are seeing a  few more positive developments in terms of design and user experience (UX) and  we therefore expect consumers to show more interest in these products in the  second half of the year."</p>

<p>Zimmermann  added that the newest devices feature improved design and provide glimpses of  what <a href="http://www.android.com/intl/en_us/wear/" target="_blank">Android Wear</a>, the  smartwatch version of Google's Android OS, can provide users.</p>
<p>Gartner also  said it expects the "quantified self" movement, in which users track  various data about daily activities such as food consumed, work productivity or  blood sugar, to contribute to the growth of smartwatches.</p>
<p>Challenges  that smartwatch makers will face, according to the company, revolve around  batteries. In tests, smartwatches and wristbands reduce the battery life of the  smartphones they're connected to by two to six hours, enough, according to the  company, "to put off most  users who use smartphones without an exchangeable battery."</p>
<p>The company also said that the number of devices that require  charging in homes is expected to rise to the point that charging becomes  burdensome, and though a more efficient battery would mitigate that issue, it  would also force smartwatches to be too bulky for consumers.</p>
<p>"We are currently seeing two opposing trends in the  market with regards to form factor evolution. On the one hand there are vendors  offering smart wrist-wearables in a familiar watch-like form factor," said  Zimmermann. "On the other hand in the past six to nine months, we have  seen vendors launching products that resemble the early fitness wristbands, but  come with displays that add significant functionality, including message and  call alerts. These cross-over products are generally marketed as fitness  devices, but with the strong slant toward the communication aspect." </p>
<p>Gartner also said that  consumers can expect to see devices from Chinese vendors, those these will only  be sold locally in the very near future.</p>
<p>"Products and offerings among Chinese vendors are  similar to those of other vendors with a variety of form factors, operating  systems, connectivity and sensor options," said McIntyre, in a prepared  statement. "International expansion will start to accelerate in 2015 and  in this context we expect several Chinese vendors to build on Android Wear in  parallel to create more appeal. Certainly, they are faced with the same hurdles  regarding design as all international vendors, but we also expect them to  leverage one thing that has been to their constant advantage in the smartphone  and tablet market: the cost advantage of the Chinese supply chain ecosystem.  Chinese vendors might well be able to bring Android Wear based smartwatches to  very affordable price points below $150 with decent designs and sensors —  driving mass market adoption."</p>
