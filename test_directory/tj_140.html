<p>The share  of online adults who say the internet has been good for society is on the  decline. While 76 percent in 2014 said the internet has been "mostly"  good, by 2018, the proportion sharing that sentiment had dropped to 70 percent.  Among older adults, those 65 and older, the shift was starkest, dropping from  78 percent in 2014 to 64 percent this year. Young people  —  ages 18 to 29   —  were slightly more upbeat; 79 percent said the internet has been mostly good  for society in 2014 compared to 74 percent in 2018.</p>
<p>These  results came from <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/04/30/declining-majority-of-online-adults-say-the-internet-has-been-good-for-society/" target="_blank">a phone survey</a> of 2,002 adults, 18 years or older,  run by the <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center</a> during January 2018.</p>
<p>Researchers  found that people aren't nearly as harsh regarding connectivity for their  personal lives. Nearly nine in 10 people (88 percent) said the internet had  been "mostly a good thing" for them personally; that dropped from 90  percent in 2014.</p>

<p>Those with  more education are also more likely to view the impact of the internet more  favorably. While 81 percent of those with a college degree said the effect on  society has been mostly good, just 65 percent of those with a high school  diploma or less agreed.</p>
<p>What do  Americans like about the internet? In an open-ended question, two-thirds (62  percent) of those with a positive view referenced how online access makes  getting information much easier and faster. A quarter (23 percent) mentioned  the ability to connect with or stay in touch with people.</p>
<p>Among  those who view the internet as a "bad" thing for society, the most  common issue that stood out (cited by 25 percent) was how it isolates people or  pushes them to spend too much time on devices. Sixteen percent talked about the  spread of fake news; 14 percent were concerned about its impact on children;  and 13 percent suggested that it "encourages illegal activity."</p>
<p>Researchers  also found that the number of homes with access to broadband is slinking  downward. Just two-thirds of respondents (65 percent) said they subscribe to a  traditional broadband service at home; that was 67 percent in 2015. Those who  use only their smartphones for home internet service are also  "disproportionately less likely" to have gone to college compared to  those who said they have traditional broadband. They also have lower income  households. While 31 percent of people with an annual household income of less  than $30,000 are smartphone-only internet users, the share drops to just nine  percent for those earning $75,000 or more.</p>
<p>The survey  also found that 15 percent of people are off the internet at home; they lack  broadband services at home and a smartphone. Most of this group also don't use  the internet or email anywhere else either.</p>
