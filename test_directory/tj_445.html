<p><a href="http://silverbacklearning.com" target="_blank">Silverback Learning Solutions</a> has partnered with the <a href="http://www.idschadm.org" target="_blank">Idaho Association of School Administrators</a> to launch the <a href="http://www.silverbacklearning.com/idaho-ims-consortium/" target="_blank">Idaho IMS Consortium</a>, a collaborative approach to supporting public education in Idaho. </p>
<p>A number of other organizations have joined forces in the consortium, including <a href="http://www.boisestate.edu">Boise State University</a>’s <a href="https://education.boisestate.edu/idaholeads/">Leads Learning Network</a>, <a href="http://www.advanc-ed.org/managing-office-locations/idaho-office">AdvancED Idaho</a>, <a href="https://www.idahodigitallearning.org" target="_blank">Idaho Digital Learning Academy</a> and <a href="http://www.gooru.org" target="_blank">Gooru</a>, to offer a comprehensive and multifaceted education solution.</p>

<p>“In Idaho, there are many rural school districts — more rural than urban or suburban,” said Alexandra Sundali, spokeswoman for Silverback Learning Solutions, in an interview. “Access to the same quality products is often an issue. [The consortium] really gives teachers in urban, suburban and rural schools the same access to quality products and services, which is very important.”</p>
<p>The Idaho IMS Consortium should not be confused with the <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org" target="_blank">IMS Global Learning Consortium</a>, which promotes interoperability standards in education.</p>
<p>Gaylen Smyer, superintendent for <a href="http://www.cassiaschools.org" target="_blank">Cassia County School District</a>, said in a prepared statement: “The consortium provides personnel in this district with greater access to products and support. Similarly, the consortium creates an inter-district network where education practitioners share experiences, ideas and solutions that directly impact classroom instruction and ultimately increase student achievement.”</p>
<p>Silverback, based in Boise, ID, produces <a href="http://www.silverbacklearning.com/products/mileposts/" target="_blank">Mileposts</a>, a cloud-based learning portfolio that helps K–12 educators and administrators create and connect personalized learning plans and interactions with assessments and instructional resources already available in schools. </p>
<p>Silverback also makes <a href="http://www.silverbacklearning.com/introducing-teacher-vitae/" target="_blank">Teacher Vitae</a>, an educator and administrator effectiveness platform that supports the professional learning process from coaching to observation to evaluation. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Idaho legislature <a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/legislation/2016/H0619.pdf" target="_blank">approved spending up to $3 million</a> for school districts and charter schools to implement and operate an instructional management system of their choice. The organizations listed above chose Silverback and to join the Idaho IMS Consortium.</p>
