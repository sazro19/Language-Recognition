<p>A private school in Los Angeles has contracted with a  security service that does its guarding remotely. <a href="http://www.villagechristian.org/" target="_blank">Village Christian School</a> is now  working with <a href="http://www.eliteinteractivesolutions.com/" target="_blank">Elite  Interactive Solutions</a>, which watches over the 110-acre campus from a command  center located underground and outfitted, according to the company, with power  sources to keep it running for up to three months.</p>
<p>The school facilities are monitored by video surveillance.  When the command center systems detect motion, human monitors can watch and  listen in on the activity, speak to the intruders and communicate with law  enforcement.</p>
<p>"Schools today face difficult security issues," said  company CEO Aria Kozak in a prepared statement. "The constant movement of  students across a large campus, relatively easy public access, and extended  after-school vacancy makes schools vulnerable to a wide variety of threats. We  view physical security from the standpoint of crime and loss prevention,  including real-time, live support during major security events."</p>
