<p><a href="http://www.eaton.k12.co.us/" target="_blank">Eaton School District</a> in northern Colorado has begun the process of upgrading to a 10 gigabit
(Gb) private fiber optic wide area network (WAN) between its three
elementary schools, one middle school and one high school. </p>
<p>The district selected <a href="http://wanrack.com/" target="_blank">WANRack</a> as its service provider for the new network based on its "cost
effective solution" and "expertise and proven track record in our
region," said Ken Reynolds, director of technology for the school
district, in a news release. Several other school districts in the
region have already implemented fiber networks from WANRack. </p>
<p>According
to information from the company, WANRack "specializes in providing
private fiber optic WAN solutions for K-12 school districts
nationwide." The company offers both lit and dark fiber networks. With a
lit fiber lease, the service provider maintains and operates the
equipment required for a fiber network to pass traffic. With a dark
fiber lease, the customer is responsible for the equipment maintenance
and operation. Eaton School District is installing a lit fiber WAN,
according to a report in FierceTelecom. </p>

<p>The school district is taking advantage of <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/summary-second-e-rate-modernization-order" target="_blank">recent changes to E-Rate funding rules</a>,
which now allow school districts to defray special construction costs
associated with network installations. The engineering and permitting
processes are currently underway, and the WAN should be ready to use
the fall. </p>
<p>The new WAN will help the district "increase
organizational efficiency and grow digital learning initiatives,"
according to a news release, and Reynolds said he expects the network to
satisfy the district's bandwidth requirements well into the future.</p>
