<p><a href="http://www.mheducation.com/" target="_blank">McGraw-Hill Education</a> has introduced <a href="http://www.mheducation.com/prek-12/explore/integration-services.html" target="_blank">Access Manager</a>, a rostering tool designed to simplify the process of moving student rosters into McGraw-Hill Education digital tools.</p>
<p>According
to information from the company, Access Manager "allows student roster
data to flow seamlessly into McGraw-Hill Education applications, and
provides administrative tools to easily manage the data." The tool is
built on the <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/onerosterlis" target="_blank">OneRoster</a> specification, a free, open standard from the <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/" target="_blank">IMS Global Learning Consortium</a>.</p>
<p>"As
districts transition to digital they need for their tools, apps and
platforms to integrate seamlessly and easily via open standards," said
Rob Abel, CEO of IMS Global Learning Consortium, in a prepared
statement. Access Manager is OneRoster 1.0 Certified, and McGraw-Hill
Education has committed to the OneRoster standard as the onboarding
specification for all of its applications in the future.</p>
