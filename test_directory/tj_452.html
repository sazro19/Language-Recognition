<p>The biggest allotment of <a href="http://usac.org/sl/" target="_blank">E-rate</a> requests in applications for fiscal year 2016 was dedicated to data and  internet service. More than $2.3 billion focused on that type of funding help,  with the E-rate portion totaling $1.8 billion and the applicant portion  covering $559 million. Nothing else came close. Requests related to voice  services reached $897 million; switches and routers extended to $743 million;  and on-campus wi-fi was $412 million.</p>
<p>Most applicants applied for Category 2 funding in FY2016.  Fifty seven percent sought E-rate discounts to cover on-campus broadband  connectivity, either in the form of internal connections or managed internal  broadband services. The average Category 2 spending per site dipped from fiscal  year 2015 to fiscal year 2016. Whereas the average school spending in 2015 was  $37,911, that had dropped to $31,032 in 2016. During the same period, the  portion of cost expected to come from the applicant rose, from 25 percent in  2015 to 29 percent in 2016.</p>
<p>Those statistics come <a href="https://fundsforlearning.app.box.com/v/2016ErateTrends" target="_blank">from a report</a> compiled by E-rate consultancy <a href="https://www.fundsforlearning.com/" target="_blank">Funds  for Learning</a> from 2016 request data. The same report also shared the results  of a survey done among a nationwide set of 1016 E-rate applicants whose  demographics equate to the overall population of applicants.</p>

<p>Fewer than one in five respondents said the funding cap was enough to meet their needs. Source: "<a href="https://www.fundsforlearning.com/2016ErateTrends.php" target="_blank">2016 E-rate Trends  Report</a>," <a href="https://www.fundsforlearning.com/" target="_blank">Funds for  Learning.</a></p>

<p>E-rate was initially created from the Telecommunications Act  of 1996 to help schools and libraries boost their communications capabilities  by providing financial support for Internet access, telecommunications and  computer networking. Currently, about 24,000 applicants participate in the  program, which has benefited 118,000 schools and libraries in the two decades since  E-rate's launch.</p>
<p>The survey found that nine in 10 respondents said they expected  to add faster internet connections over the next three years. Two-thirds (65  percent) said they expected to attain a bandwidth increase of 50 percent or  more from what they currently have in place.</p>
<p>Much of that growth is directly tied to <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2014/12/11/ed-tech-leaders-applaud-fcc-decision-to-increase-funding-for-broadband.aspx" target="_blank">a  major change made in 2014</a> by the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/" target="_blank">Federal  Communications Commission</a>, which modernized the E-rate regulations and put  new emphasis on high-speed connectivity to buildings and on campus Internet  access.</p>
<p>As part of that program update the FCC poured more funding  into E-rate and set a five-year $150/student budget cap to enable schools and  libraries to update their Category 2 infrastructure rapidly. According to the  survey, only 20 percent of applicants have "exhausted" or will use up  their budget cap by the end of the 2016 fiscal year. Another 63 percent reported  they anticipate doing so by the end of fiscal year 2019. And 15 percent said  they don't expect to hit their funding caps at all.</p>
<p>However, the cap may not be enough. The survey found that  more than eight in 10 applicants (82 percent) said they consider the $150 cap  insufficient to meet their school's needs. Perhaps that's why almost all  respondents (94 percent) said they expect to continue applying for E-rate  funding in the future.</p>
<p>Yet three-quarters of applicants (76 percent) agreed with  the statement, "We have faster Internet because of the E-rate  program."</p>
<p>What changes would applicants like to see made? Twelve  percent said they'd like to see filtering/security solutions become part of the  eligible services list and 10 percent said they would like to add end-user  devices.</p>
