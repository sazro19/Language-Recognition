<p><a href="http://corporate.comcast.com" target="_blank">Comcast’s</a> <a href="https://internetessentials.com" target="_blank">Internet Essentials</a> program has helped 3 million low-income Americans, or 750,000 families, access low-cost, high-speed internet service at home, according to a <a href="http://corporate.comcast.com/images/internet-essentials-five-year-progress-report.pdf" target="_blank">five-year progress report</a> the company released today.</p>
<p>Comcast is also providing more than $2 million in grants to community-based organizations that provide digital literacy training and internet access, the company said in a news release.</p>
<p>“In the last five years, we’ve learned that no single company or government program is ever going to fix the digital divide and that solving a big, difficult societal issue like this takes nothing short of a movement,” said David L. Cohen, senior executive vice president and chief diversity officer of Comcast, in a prepared statement. “We are so proud that thousands of community partners around the country have helped us make a meaningful dent in the digital divide.” </p>

<p>Cohen also mentioned that the Internet Essentials program is expanding to HUD-assisted homes over the next five years. The company estimates that up to 2 million HUD-assisted homes are in Comcast’s service area across the country, representing 40 percent of HUD-assisted households.</p>
<p>Since the launch of the Internet Essentials program in 2011, Comcast has also provided more than $300 million in cash and in-kind support to help fund digital literacy training and educational initiatives nationally, the company said in its release. Those efforts have reached nearly 4.4 million people, Comcast said.</p>
<p>Between 2011 and June 2016, Comcast has also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dedicated more than $1.8 million in grants to create Internet Essentials Learning Zones;</li>
<li>Broadcast 8.5 million public service announcements, valued at nearly $110 million;</li>
<li>Provided more than 54,000 subsidized computers priced at less than $150 each;</li>
<li>Distributed nearly 53 million pieces of Internet Essentials program materials for free;</li>
<li>Offered Internet Essentials to more than 55,000 schools in over 5,000 school districts in 39 states and the District of Columbia; and</li>
<li>Partnered with more than 9,000 community-based organizations and government agencies and elected officials to spread the word.</li>
</ul>
<p>The company also announced that Olympic champion <a href="http://jackiejoynerkersee.com" target="_blank">Jackie Joyner-Kersee</a> is the new national spokesperson for the program, and she is kicking off a multi-city tour during back-to-school season.</p>
