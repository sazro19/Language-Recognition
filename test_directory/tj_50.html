<p>(Updated June 10, 2020; originally published April 30, 2020) While <a href="https://stateofthestates.educationsuperhighway.org/#national" target="_blank">EducationSuperHighway</a> <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2020/02/11/free-tool-to-supply-broadband-speed-and-pricing-data-to-districts.aspx" target="_blank">recently reported</a> that the classroom connectivity gap was "now closed," with 99 percent of schools on fiber, that didn't take into account that school would move home in a time of coronavirus. The <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/broadband-progress-reports/2019-broadband-deployment-report" target="_blank">latest reporting by the Federal Communications Commission</a>, found that the number of people lacking a connection of at least 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload was 21.3 million in the United States at the end of 2017. Some 4.3 million were in rural America or tribal lands. According to <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/kids-action/publications/homework-gap" target="_blank">Common Sense Media</a>, that translated to almost 12 million children nationwide in homes without a broadband connection.</p>

<p>How school districts are getting education delivered to those students varies from location to location. To help your schools reach students who may lack broadband connectivity, here's a list of wireless networking options they may be able to take advantage of. We've listed those that are available in more than just a handful of states first.</p>
<p>We developed the compilation by starting with a list of telecommunications companies that have signed the Federal Communications Commission's "<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/keep-americans-connected" target="_blank">Keep Americans Connected</a>" pledge. Editors culled through the list specifically seeking information online about those companies that provided free service to students in their coverage areas and/or free public WiFi hotspots that students could access for some portion of each day while sitting in their cars or otherwise being physically isolated from others in the vicinity. </p>
<p>We will continue updating this list as information becomes available. If you know of other services not included on the list, please send details with a link to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4a38212f2626330a7b7b7a7f272f2e232b64292527"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5b29303e3737221b6a6a6b6e363e3f323a75383436">[email protected]</span></a>. </p>
