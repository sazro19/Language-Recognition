<p>A joint school district in New Hampshire is taking advantage  of E-rate discounts to add fiber, Internet and voice services in its schools. <a href="http://www.franklin.k12.nh.us/" target="_blank">Franklin &amp; Hill School Districts SAU  #18</a> will be working with <a href="http://www.firstlight.net/" target="_blank">FirstLight  Fiber</a>, a telecommunications service provider based in New York and New  England.</p>
<p>The vendor will connect the four-school district's  elementary and middle schools back to the high school for "fast reach  dedicated internet connections for WAN resources," according to the school  system's <a href="http://www.franklin.k12.nh.us/SAU/SAU%20Technology%20Plan%202015.pdf" target="_blank">latest  technology plan</a>. Additionally, the company will implement voice services  for three schools within the district.</p>
<p>The district chose FirstLight in a bid process specifically  for its pricing, bandwidth speeds and customer service and support.</p>
<p>"FirstLight's high quality fiber connections provide  the speeds essential to support the new age of learning in our schools and  allow our staff and students the consistent, reliable service needed to  maintain our cloud and server based environments," said Adam Hollins,  district IT director. "We have been very pleased with FirstLight's level  of knowledge, professionalism and quality of its services and support."</p>
