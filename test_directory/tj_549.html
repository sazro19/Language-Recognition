<p><a href="http://www.havasu.k12.az.us/" target="_blank">Lake Havasu Unified School District</a> in Arizona has selected a new student information system (SIS) and
special education management system to replace its existing SIS. The district plans to implement the new SIS over the summer and
expects to have it in place for the beginning of the 2016-17 school
year.</p>
<p>In 2014, the <a href="http://www.azed.gov/" target="_blank">Arizona Department of Education</a> (ADE) awarded a <a href="http://www.azed.gov/aelas/ssis/" target="_blank">Statewide Student Information System</a> (SSIS) contract to <a href="http://www.edupoint.com/" target="_blank">Edupoint Educational Systems</a> as part of the <a href="http://www.azed.gov/aelas/" target="_blank">Arizona Education Learning and Accountability System</a> (AELAS). Through this program, local education agencies throughout the
state have the option to adopt Edupoint's Synergy SIS at a
pre-negotiated price. </p>
<p>Lake Havasu USD serves 5,400 students
across eight campuses. The school district had been looking for "an
integrated solution that would seamlessly share data across different
systems to simplify their processes and improve student outcomes, and
felt Synergy would best fit their needs," according to a statement from
Bob Weathers, founder and CEO of Edupoint, in a news release.</p>

<p>The
new SIS will give the district student information management
functionality, as well as scheduling, gradebook and family engagement
capabilities. It will also help the district integrate with other ADE
systems, according to a news release from Edupoint. The Synergy Special
Education module, which is an optional add-on through the SSIS program,
will "enable the district to manage their special education process
from start to finish while providing oversight to ensure federal and
state regulations are being met," stated the news release.</p>
<p>Edupoint
modules included in Arizona's SSIS program include School Office
Administration, TeacherVUE Gradebook, ParentVUE Web Portal, StudentVUE
Web Portal, Scheduling, Querying and Reporting and AZ State Reporting.
Synergy Special Education is an optional module not included in the
core package. Other modules that the district has the option to adopt
through the program include Synergy Online Registration, LessonVUE
curriculum and instructional management and Synergy Assessment.</p>
