<p>The <a href="http://www.wsipc.org/" target="_blank">Washington School Information Processing  Cooperative</a> (WSIPC) has expanded its relationship with a  provider of tools for gathering student information.</p>
<p>The  nonprofit WSIPC provides information and technology services to more than 280 K-12  member schools. As part of the expanded partnership, the organization will now  offer <a href="https://www.infosnap.com/splash/" target="_blank">InfoSnap's</a> lottery, school  choice and enrollment solutions in addition to the company's registration tool.</p>
<p>"WSIPC's work with InfoSnap enables schools  to streamline their business processes for enrolling and registering students,"  said Marty Daybell, executive director of WSIPC, in a prepared  statement. "We sustain a continuous commitment to ensuring that all WSIPC  member schools have access to intuitive technology solutions. With the advent  of Charter schools in several states, we are extending the agreement to include  school choice, lottery, and open enrollment solutions to those Charter schools  who are members of WSIPC."</p>
