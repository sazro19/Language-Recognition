<p class="deck" id="ph_pcontent3_3_Deck">As technology has changed K–12 education, so has it changed the role of the chief technology officer, a job title that just barely existed 15 years ago. Today's CTO is not your grandfather's infrastructure manager!</p>

<p>Technology is ubiquitous in today's classroom, so we sometimes forget it was just a short while ago that not even teachers had their own computers, let alone their students, who now sometimes come to school with two or three electronic devices.</p>
<p><em>THE Journal</em> contributing writer Michael Hart spoke recently with four veteran chief technology officers who were present at almost the very introduction of technology to K–12 education and asked them how their jobs have changed over the last 15 to 20 years.</p>
<p><strong>THE Journal: How has the role of the chief technology officer in K–12 education changed over the last 20 years?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Keith Krueger</strong>: Twenty years ago, when CoSN was started, there wasn't a career path to what we now call a CTO. It was only about 15 years ago that we started using that as a generic term for the lead person for technology in a school district.</p>
<p><strong>Kurt Madden</strong>: In the beginning it was all about wired networks and wired infrastructure. There was no wireless. Now, it's about moving things to the cloud. It's a lot more about facilitating collaboration and communication.</p>
<p>And it's about analytics. Back then, you captured student data, but you didn't spend much time providing it for reports. We do more analytics of student and employee data to improve student results, hiring results and to improve professional learning.</p>

<p>Mark Finstrom has been CTO of Highline Public Schools in the Seattle area since 2006, but began his career in educational technology 20 years ago.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Mark Finstrom</strong>: It used to be that I dealt with buying and managing the hardware and software. And I provided services to the end user. That's no longer the case. Everything we do is integrating one thing with another thing.</p>
<p><strong>Krueger</strong>: Fifteen years ago, 80 percent of your job was wires and boxes. Today, that's only about 30 percent of the job. Now, the vast majority is understanding the education environment and, increasingly, you have to have leadership and vision skills.</p>
<p><strong>Finstrom</strong>: It's figuring out what 50 different applications are we using and how do I merge those together and the data within those so that the teacher can say, "Jimmy's actually on par today." Or, "Wow, I've got some work to do because Jimmy is falling behind."</p>
<p><strong>THE Journal: What role does the CTO now play in the district-wide decision-making process compared to 10 or 20 years ago?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Madden</strong>: The stakes are much higher today.</p>
<p><strong>Finstrom</strong>: Nine or 10 years ago, I wasn't even on the cabinet. I was considered an operations person. It was not necessary for me to be involved in decisions related to instruction because the accountability was with the superintendent. Now, if I'm not at the table, they don't know how to get to the data they're looking for. They don't know what systems are available for us to provide feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Frankie Jackson</strong>: The primary difference is that we now work with executive-level leadership. Twenty years ago, technology leaders were thought to be leaders of hardware and software, leaders of student information systems. But since then, there's been this gradual move to where now technology is the underlying foundation of all services.</p>
