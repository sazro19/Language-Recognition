<p>While Race to the Top (RTT) funding did introduce more use  of the policies and best practices promoted by the federal program, the impact  of those changes on student achievement is "unclear," according to the  latest reporting from an ongoing study undertaken for the <a href="https://ies.ed.gov/" target="_blank">United States Department of Education's Institute of  Education Sciences</a>.</p>
<p>In 2010, 11 states and the District of Columbia received  $4.35 billion in two rounds of RTT grants based both on their education reform  plans and their past success in creating conditions for reform. In an  evaluation led by <a href="https://www.mathematica-mpr.com/" target="_blank">Mathematica Policy  Research</a> and supported by the <a href="http://www.air.org/" target="_blank">American  Institutes for Research</a> and <a href="https://www.spra.com/" target="_blank">Social Policy  Research Associates</a> researchers found that these "early" states  reported the use of RTT-promoted activities in four of six areas more  successfully than states that didn't receive the grants:</p>

<ul>
<li>Turning around low-performing schools;</li>
<li>Adopting standards and assessments that prepare  students to succeed in college and the workplace;</li>
<li>Encouraging conditions in which charter schools  can succeed; and</li>
<li>Improving teacher and principal effectiveness. </li>
</ul>
<p>However, the researchers emphasized, those differences may  not be directly tied to RTT, since states were already using some of those  practices when they received the grants.</p>
<p><img alt="While Race to the Top (RTT) funding did introduce more use of the policies and best practices promoted by the federal program, the impact of those changes on student achievement is " height="406" src="/-/media/EDU/THEJournal/Images/2016/11/20161110rtt.jpg" width="644"/> </p>
<p>In two other areas — building state data systems that  measure student growth and inform instruction and improving state capacity to  support school improvement efforts — there were no differences between states  that did or didn't receive the grants.</p>
<p>The seven states that that received their RTT grants in 2011,  during a third round of funding, reported using more practices related to  teacher and principal certification and evaluation than non-RTT states in  spring 2013.</p>
<p>Overall, states' use of practices — whether they were RTT  recipients or not — was lowest in the area of teacher and principal  certification and evaluation (26 percent). It was highest in the use of data  systems (76 percent). The largest difference between states with and without  RTT grants showed up in standards and assessments.</p>
<p>Also, early RTT states reported using more English language  learner (ELL)-focused policies and practices promoted by RTT than non-RTT  states. No differences were found in that area between "later" RTT  states and non-RTT states.</p>
<p>Figuring out what impact RTT has had on student progress was  difficult, the report noted, because the outcomes could be interpreted in  several ways: "as providing evidence of a positive effect of RTT, a  negative effect of RTT, or no effect of RTT." The uncertainty was  "partly due," the researchers explained, "to the difficulty in  separating the effect of RTT from overall trends in student outcomes and partly  due to the limited amount of data available for the analysis."</p>
<p>"In sum, it is not clear whether the RTT grants  improved student achievement," said, Mathematica Senior Researcher <a href="https://mathematica-mpr.com/our-people/staff/lisa-dragoset" target="_blank">Lisa Dragoset</a>,  who led the evaluation, in a statement. "Differences in student  achievement between RTT states and other states may be due to other factors and  not to the program. For example, RTT states differed from other states before  receiving the grants in a number of ways. Other changes that occurred at the  same time as RTT reforms may also have affected student achievement."</p>
<p>To develop their findings, the researchers held phone  interviews with representatives from state education agencies in all 50 states  as well as the District of Columbia, collecting information about educational  policies, practices and support related to the six areas that RTT promoted.  Analysis of the tie between RTT and student achievement was based on publicly  available, state-level test scores from the National Assessment of Educational  Progress (NAEP).</p>
