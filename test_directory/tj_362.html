<p>When the  well financed organization inBloom shuttered its doors just a year after its  official launch, many in the ed tech industry were surprised. How could  something that started with such promise to help schools and districts get  their arms around the use of data for improving student outcomes dissolve so  suddenly? A new report has suggested, however, that failure was almost  inevitable.</p>
<p>The  autopsy to determine the cause of the demise of inBloom was undertaken by <a href="https://datasociety.net/" target="_blank">Data  &amp; Society</a>, a  research institute in New York City that examines the issues that arise in  data-centric technology development.</p>
<p>inBloom  was a "go big" $100 million project mainly underwritten by the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Bill  &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> to create an open source platform for data sharing, learning apps and  curriculum. At the heart were web-based services that would allow districts and  states to maintain data from multiple systems in a common location with a set  of application programming interfaces. The idea was to take over the under-the-surface  operations or plumbing aspects of education technology to accelerate the  development of useful tools for educator purposes.</p>

<p>As "<a href="https://datasociety.net/pubs/ecl/InBloom_feb_2017.pdf" target="_blank">The Legacy of inBloom</a>" pointed out, state  departments of education came together to pilot the early work that led to  inBloom because they believed it could support their Race to the Top efforts in  innovating education with the smart use of data.</p>
<p>However,  explaining the work being done by inBloom was a challenge. "Throughout its  brief history, the organization and the product seemed to embody contradictory  business models, software development approaches, philosophies and  cultures," the report stated. "There was a clash between Silicon  Valley-style agile software development methods and the slower moving, more  risk-averse approaches of states and school districts. At times, it was as  though a team of brilliant thinkers had harvested every 'best practice' or  innovative idea in technology, business and education — but failed to whittle  them down to a manageable and cohesive strategy."</p>
<p>The timing  of the introduction of inBloom in 2013 during an atmosphere of mistrust of data  use didn't help either. That was the same year Edward Snowden revealed just how  much data the National Security Agency was collecting on U.S. civilians and  that retailers such as Target were reporting multi-million-customer data  breaches. "The beginnings of a national awareness of the volume of  personal data generated by everyday use of credit cards, digital devices and  the internet were coupled with emerging fears and uncertainty," the  authors wrote.</p>
<p>Vocal parents  began protesting the increased usage of student data and the perceived threat  that schools would sell their children's information to companies for marketing  and advertising purposes. Opponents of the Common Core and new kinds of state  testing began accusing the organizations sustaining inBloom as mining student  data "for some corporate benefit." "inBloom was caught in a  riptide of criticism about a wide range of education reform initiatives,"  the report observed.</p>
<p>Under the  weight of political pressures, the states and large school districts that were  early supporters of inBloom began shrinking away. Over the course of seven  months, the coalition of states had withered from nine to three. New York,  which had remained "publicly committed" but where opposition was the  noisiest, eventually fell as well, toppled by a widely publicized lawsuit (eventually  dismissed) regarding the sharing of student data with inBloom. Within weeks  inBloom stopped operations.</p>
