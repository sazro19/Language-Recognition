<p><a href="https://www.lenovosoftware.com/" target="_blank">Lenovo</a> has  updated its <a href="https://www.lenovosoftware.com/lanschool" target="_blank">LanSchool  Classroom Management</a> tool with expanded Chromebook support and other  improvements.</p>
<p>Designed to encourage collaboration while limiting  distractions, LanSchool v8.0 also offers eight-times-faster screen sharing than  previous versions and a redesigned reports server for greater filtering and  monitoring support.</p>
<p>"Expanded support for e-safety in the classroom  provides teachers and administrators with customizable alerts and snapshots of 'banned  words' and phrases so that an adult will know when any student is engaging in  inappropriate behavior using their device," according to a news release. "Enhanced  capacity, screen capture alerts and instant reporting help protect students  from online dangers and can monitor any problems students are expressing."</p>
<p>"LanSchool Classroom Management has made a huge impact  on our district and teachers," said Geoffrey S. Graboyes, systems support  specialist II at <a href="http://www.browardschools.com/" target="_blank">Broward County Public  Schools</a>, in a prepared statement. "The software has enabled teachers  to take back control of the classroom while using technology. It's easy to use  and makes teachers feel empowered while engaging their students while using  technology."</p>
