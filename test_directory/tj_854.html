<p><a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/home.jsp" target="_blank">Gartner</a> has looked at the digital future and found it in flux. During its annual <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/symposium/" target="_blank">symposium and ITxpo</a> in  Orlando, the IT consulting firm presented 10 technology trends expected to have  "strategic impact" in most organizations, which may mean disruption  to the business, users or IT; which may call for "major investment";  or which may pose unforeseen risks if ignored.</p>
<p>"This does not necessarily mean adoption and investment  in all of the trends at the same rate, but companies should look to make  deliberate decisions about them during the next two years," advised David  Cearley, vice president and Gartner fellow.</p>
<p><strong>User Experience over  User Devices</strong><br/>
As the number of mobile devices in use grows through a  proliferation of phones and smart wearables, the IT organization will face  management challenges that focus not on the devices but on the experiences of  the user. "Increasingly, it's the overall environment that will need to  adapt to the requirements of the mobile user."</p>

<p><strong>The Digitizing of  Everything</strong><br/>
While the "Internet of Things" (IoT) has become a  continual topic of consideration by IT, the reality is that the data streams  and services generated through digitizing "everything" actually  creates "four basic usage models": manage, monetize, operate and extend.  For instance, Gartner stated, "the pay-per-use model could be applied to  assets (such as industrial equipment), services (such as pay-as-you-drive  insurance), people (such as movers), places (such as parking spots) and systems  (such as cloud services)."</p>

<em><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gartner" target="_blank">#Gartner</a>: By 2015,  more than 40 vendors will have "managed services offerings leveraging  smart machines and industrialized services."</em></p>
<p><strong>3D Printing Reaches a  Tipping Point</strong><br/>
Gartner projects that worldwide shipments of 3D printers will  nearly double in 2015 and double again in the following year. New applications  for industry, medicine and consumer use will prove the efficacy of the  technology in reducing costs "through improved designs, streamlined  prototyping and short-run manufacturing."</p>

<em><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gartner" target="_blank">#Gartner</a>: "By  2017, nearly 20% of durable goods e-tailers will use 3D printing to create  personalized product offerings."</em></p>
<p><strong>Analytics Permeate Software</strong><br/>
Finding meaning in the data generated by embedded and other  systems will become a function within every app and application we use. "Organizations  need to manage how best to filter the huge amounts of data coming from the IoT,  social media and wearable devices, and then deliver exactly the right  information to the right person, at the right time. Analytics will become  deeply but invisibly embedded everywhere," said Cearley. However, the  focus needs to move off of the existence of "big data" and move onto  "big questions and big answers," he reminded attendees.</p>

<em><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gartner" target="_blank">#Gartner</a>: "By  2020...businesses using targeted messaging with internal positioning systems  will see a 5% increase in sales"</em></p>
<p><strong>Systems Will Show  "Smarts"...</strong><br/>
The existence of pervasive analytics will enable systems to  become "alert" to their environments and respond appropriately. That  will have application in "context-aware" security, in which a user  request will be analyzed and the response adjusted based on what the systems  know about the specific context in which the request is being asked. With time  other uses will surface.</p>
