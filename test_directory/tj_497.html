<p>Aerohive’s <a href="http://www.aerohive.com/products/network-management/hivemanager-ng.html">HiveManager NG</a> is a cloud-based management platform. It helps connect tablets, laptops, smart boards, online curricula and collaboration tools online and between teachers and students.</p>
<p>Aerohive will also display its latest 802.11ac Wave 2 access points, which together with HiveManager NG and Aerohive SR2208P, SR2224P and SR 2348P switches deliver the most adaptable cloud-enabled network infrastructure, Aerohive said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Milpitas, CA-based company will also provide demonstrations of an upgraded version of <a href="http://www.aerohive.com/products/applications/hiveschool.html">HiveSchool</a>, a connected learning application that helps teachers use classroom technologies to provide engaging, collaborative and effective learning experiences for students, Aerohive said.
