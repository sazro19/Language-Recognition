<p><a href="http://www.hp.com/go/mfp" target="_blank">HP</a> has debuted a new printer that enables users to print from mobile devices. The printer, designed for classrooms as well as small to medium size business environments, also allows users to access content from cloud applications including Box and Google Drive. </p>
<p>The HP Color LaserJet Pro MFP M476 offers secure wireless printing from "smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices," according to a company statement. Files are transmitted to the printer through a peer-to-peer connection using 128-bit encryption. The printer comes with a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) feature that enables IT administrators to define user restrictions for scan, copy or fax functions. </p>
<p>The M476 has received Mopria certification. The <a href="http://www.mopria.org/" target="_blank">Mopria Alliance</a>, established in 2013 by an alliance of mobile device and printer manufacturers, aims to "promote, simplify and increase accessibility of wireless printing from mobile devices."</p>
<p>The printer will be available for purchase starting April 2014. Additional information about HP's printers is available <a href="http://www.hp.com/go/mfp" target="_blank">online</a>.</p>
