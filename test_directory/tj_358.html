<p>A <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/01/26/3-attitudes-about-cybersecurity-policy/" target="_blank">recent report</a> by the <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/" target="_blank">Pew  Research Center</a> has found that while Americans don't trust institutions such as government  agencies or major corporations to protect their personal data, they also don't  follow cybersecurity best practices in their own lives.</p>
<p>The  results came from a survey of 1,040 adults in spring 2016 across the country.  Two-thirds of respondents (64 percent) have experienced some form of data theft  or fraud; four in 10 (41 percent) have experienced fraudulent credit card  charges; a third (35 percent) have received notices that sensitive information  has been compromised; and other problems have included takeover of e-mail or  social media accounts, compromise of Social Security numbers, loans taken out  in their names or impersonation in filing fake tax returns.</p>

<p>Nearly half  of Americans (49 percent) said they feel their personal data is less secure  than it has been in the past. People 50 and older are especially likely to feel  this way compared to those who are 18 to 49 years old (58 percent versus 41  percent).</p>
<p>A similar  number of respondents said that organizations that collect their personal data  can't keep it safe from misuse. At the top of the list, 51 percent of  individuals who use social media sites said they have no confidence in those  types of organizations to protect their personal data. The federal government  generated nearly as much mistrust; 49 percent said it's not to be trusted with  data.</p>
<p>But even  as distrust grows regarding how well institutions can safeguard data, the  respondents admitted that they don't necessarily follow cybersecurity best  practices in their digital lives. For example, even while best practice is to  use a password management program to maintain and track online passwords, 86  percent of people memorize passwords and 49 percent write them down on a piece  of paper. Only 12 percent use a password management program, while 18 percent  save passwords in their internet browser and 24 percent save them on a computer  or mobile device. Researchers found little difference in these practices even  among those respondents who had experienced a data breach.</p>
<p>Mobile  security is another area of conflict. More than half of adults who get online  (54 percent) said they'll use public hotspots for sensitive activities, such as  online banking, despite the possible insecurity of those WiFi networks.  Twenty-eight percent of smartphone owners said they don't use screen lock or  some other kind of security feature to access their phone. About one in 10 said  they never install updates to their smartphone apps or operating system.</p>
<p>The news  about personal safety isn't all bad, however. The survey found that more than  half of respondents (52 percent) said they use two-step authentication on some  of their online accounts. And a majority also said they use different passwords  for different sites or place security features on their phones.</p>
<p>The topic  of encryption and whether government agencies should be able to break into or  bypass encrypted communications showed some divisions. In 2016, when the FBI obtained  a court order to force Apple to unlock the iPhone belonging to one of the  people responsible for the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Pew did a survey  that found that 51 percent of Americans believed Apple should be required to  unlock the iPhone.</p>
<p>In this  more general survey, however, Pew found that 46 percent of respondents agreed  that the government should have access to encrypted communications when  investigating crimes. A similar number said tech companies should be able to  use unbreakable encryption. And 4 percent said their opinion would depend on  the circumstances. The research organization found that response varied by  gender, age and political affiliation.</p>
