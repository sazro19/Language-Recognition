<h3 class="title" id="ph_pcontent3_3_MainHeading">Baking Interoperability Functions into Classroom Management Tools</h3>
<ul class="byline" id="ph_pcontent3_3_ByAuthor">
<li class="author">By Sara Friedman</li><li class="date">10/02/19</li>
</ul>
<p>In March 2018, the <a href="https://cosn.org/" target="_blank">Consortium for School Networking (CoSN)</a> began developing a framework and toolkit to give schools resources on how to make interoperability a key component of any IT system purchase. On Tuesday, CoSN made the last two resources in <a href="https://cosn.org/interoperability" target="_blank">the toolkit</a> available to the public—a guide for request for proposals and discussion tools to provide a starting point for conversations.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cosn.org/sites/default/files/RFP_Considerations_v6_0.pdf">guide</a> recommends six items that school should consider when developing RFPs and evaluating bids:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provider has signed and adheres to the <a href="https://studentprivacypledge.org/privacy-pledge/" target="_blank">Future of Privacy Forum and SIIA Student Privacy Pledge</a>.</li>
<li>Provider adheres to common industry interoperability standards used by your district.</li>
<li>Provider has signed the <a href="https://www.projunicorn.org/vendor-pledge" target="_blank">Project Unicorn EdTech Vendor Pledge</a>.</li>
<li>Moving data from one system to another does NOT require manual data entry or ETL (Extract, Transform, Load).   </li>
<li>Provider has automated processes in place to ensure data accuracy and integrity and flags for manual data-cleansing. </li>
<li>Core school data should be stored in a CEDS-aligned format and exportable to a standardized format that is aligned to CEDS.</li>
</ol>

<p>The discussion tools include a flyer and PowerPoint presentation that schools can use to facilitate early conversations to identify their interoperability needs. The slides include talking points with relevant statistics, graphics and cost considerations.</p>
<p>"Achieving interoperability can be a complicated process for school districts. It's important to reduce that impediment and not discourage the use of e-learning technologies. The complete Interoperability Toolkit gives ed tech leaders a full range of resources to leverage in one convenient space," said CoSN CEO Keith Krueger.</p>
<p>The complete toolkit also features a self-assessment quiz for districts to determine system maturity, a cost calculator, interoperability standards and four case studies.</p>
<p><a href="https://cosn.org/interoperability" target="_blank">All of the interoperability resources can be found on CoSN's website. </a> </p>
