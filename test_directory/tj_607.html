<p><a href="http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/" target="_blank">PBS LearningMedia</a>, the
on-demand media service for K-12 classrooms, has added new features and tools,
and the company has also launched a free iPad app for students.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pbs-students/id972063192?ls=1&amp;mt=8" target="_blank">PBS
Students</a> app offers videos, games and images from PBS and PBS Kids,
including resources from Nova, Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood and the Ken Burns
collection, as well as thousands of other resources covering math, science,
English language arts, social studies and other subject areas. According to the
company, the app is designed to complement the PBS LearningMedia Student
portal, which launched earlier this year.</p>
<p>New features and tools added to the PBS LearningMedia service are intended
to make it easier for teachers to implement the company's digital media
resources in the classroom. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Puzzle Builder, which lets teachers create interactive word searches and
    crossword puzzles that can be printed, or that students can complete on a
    computer or tablet;</li>
<li>Quiz Maker, which lets teachers create online short answer, essay,
    multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank or true/false quizzes;</li>
<li>Lesson Builder, which lets teachers combine digital resource from PBS
    LearningMedia with their own content;</li>
<li>Tools for teachers to build their own digital content and share it with
    other educators;</li>
<li>Quick Assign, which is designed to make it easier for teachers to assign
    or share resources in the PBS LearningMedia library; and</li>
<li>A new curriculum calendar and events guide to help teachers access free
    professional development opportunities.</li>
</ul>
