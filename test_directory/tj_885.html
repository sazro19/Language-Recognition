<p><a href="http://www.blackboard.com/" target="_blank">Blackboard</a> has a released a free mobile  app, <a href="http://www.myjobgenie.com/" target="_blank">Job Genie</a>, designed to help  students explore career paths and college options.</p>
<p>"The app is a result of <a href="http://roe.myedu.com/student-journey/myedu-publishes-academic-journey-research-students-lack-support-in-major-selection/" target="_blank">qualitative  research</a> with students that indicated a large amount of apprehension around  key academic decisions, such as picking a school, major or career path,"  according to a news release. "Designed to be a non-threatening way to  explore various education and job options, the app uses casual language and  aesthetics to reinforce that these choices are part of a journey and that  students should not feel locked into a single recommendation."</p>
<p>"I think everyone wishes they had a  plan," said a student who participated in the study, in a prepared  statement "And even if you have a great plan, pressure from parents,  difficult courses and other bumps in the road make it tough to always see the  next step. It's nice to know that I can just pull out my phone and have my own  personal career counselor at my fingertips." </p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/sites/labs/" target="_blank">Blackboard  Labs</a> release, the app is currently in beta and will be updated following  feedback from early users. It provides lists of schools, degrees and job  options based on answers to personality, interest and achievement questions. In  addition to the lists, the app provides information about salaries and cost of  living, as well as videos from professionals in the field about day to day job  activities.</p>
<p>"Students tend to feel locked into choices they make  very early in their educational journey, which can make the selection of a  career path intimidating," said Mark Strassman, senior vice president of  product management at Blackboard, in a prepared statement. "It's important  for them to feel comfortable with a certain amount of experimentation, learning  and discovery. Through this app, we aim to provide relevant data to help  students make informed decisions. We are fully committed to building solutions  from the learner's perspective and helping them become more career-ready and,  ultimately, successful."</p>
