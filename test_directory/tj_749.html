<p><a href="www.shakopee.k12.mn.us" target="_blank">Shakopee
Public Schools</a> (SPS) in suburban Minneapolis has
consolidated all of its administrative functions into a single
system.</p>
<p>The 7,600-student school district now has a single
administrative suite, provided by <a href="https://www.infinitecampus.com" target="_blank">Infinite
Campus</a>, which accommodates its
student information system as well as its finance, human resources,
payroll and
business functions. A one-time mix of independently operated functions,
some of
them managed by third parties, now provides reports and functions from a
single
source, streamlining procedures and increasing efficiency.</p>
<p>Using the Infinite Campus student information system along with Campus Finance,
HR and
Payroll should allow district officials to share more data across the
district.</p>
<p>"We used to spend a lot of time massaging data to
make it
useful," said SPS Finance Director Mike Burlager. "We no longer have to
do
that."</p>
<p>Likewise, the district no longer needs to send
e-mails
notifying staff of administrative updates. Instead, changes can be made
immediately
available throughout the system.</p>

<p>"Now,‚Äù Burlager said, "if human resources adds a
teacher to
the system, the information is instantly available to everybody. Campus
integration keeps information accurate and timely."</p>
<p>At the same time, many more staff members can have
access to
information and create and share reports that package information in
more
meaningful ways for them.</p>
<p>"This means our business office no longer receives
calls to
pull specific reports," Burlager said, "a big benefit of using one
system."</p>
