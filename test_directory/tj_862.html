<p>For K-12 ed tech leaders, budgets are chronically tight. One way to make the most of your available funds is to let the strength in numbers work for you by joining a buying network. Districts and educational consortia around the country are doing just that by using buying cooperatives like <a href="http://www.tcpn.org/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">The Cooperative Purchasing Network</a> (TCPN), <a href="http://www.aepacoop.org/pages/Association_of_Educational_Pur" target="_blank">the Association of Educational Purchasing Agencies</a> (AEPA) and <a href="http://www.thekpn.org" target="_blank">Keystone Purchasing Network</a> to buy new hardware and software for their institutions. Here, they discuss how working with a middle man can actually save them money and time.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive Pricing</strong><br/>
<a href="http://www.edmonds.wednet.edu/site/default.aspx?PageID=1" target="_blank">Edmonds School District</a> in Lynnwood, WA has certainly benefited from the services of buying cooperatives. According to Sandi Masterman, purchasing agent for the 32-school, 20,000-student district, it most recently worked with <a href="http://www.govconnection.com/?cm_mmc=Google-_-Gov_Connection_-_Branded-_-Gov_Connection-_-govconnection&amp;iprospect&amp;gclid=CJSxr9mlxb8CFdBi7AodIicAUQ" target="_blank">GovConnection</a> to negotiate TCPN pricing on a contract (with the former serving as the intermediary). Through the arrangement, in 2012 the district purchased Lenovo desktops, tablets, monitors, keyboards and microphones. </p>

<p>"Pretty much everything that Lenovo sells — plus the remainder of GovConnection's catalog — can be purchased off a TCPN contract," said Masterman. "When we compared that to past contracts and the opportunity to buy direct, we found the buying group pretty advantageous in terms of the competitive price points." </p>
<p>To get involved, the district had to join TCPN, which offers members the opportunity to leverage any of the buying group's current bids. </p>
<p>Once the items are procured, districts like Edmonds work directly with the vendor (in this case, Lenovo) to manage delivery and technical/customer support. Masterman, who has used cooperative purchasing to acquire myriad products and materials — not just technology — said that gaining access to significant buying power is the biggest benefit that the district gains. </p>
<p>"It also helps whittle down the competitive bid process," said Masterman, "and gain the group's cumulative power, which far exceeds our individual buying power." </p>
<p>Chris Bailey, the manager of IT operations at Edmonds SD, said that when the district was buying Lenovo equipment directly from the manufacturer, it was paying more. "We're saving money by going through a third party, essentially," said Bailey. "In addition, the purchasing contracts allow us to move a little bit more quickly when we go through a formal bid process." </p>
<p><strong>Expedited Purchasing</strong><br/>
Bailey's second point is particularly significant because the time between defining specification and actually awarding a contract can range from three to six months. "There are certain protocols we need to go through as a school, and certainly as basically a state agency, that takes time," he said. "With a contract, however, we can submit whatever we need and reference the contract. We get the product within a week or two."</p>
<p>Like Masterman and Bailey, Elizabeth Walden, network manager for the <a href="http://www.jcsb.org/" target="_blank">Jackson County School District</a> in Marianna, FL, said she likes using purchasing cooperatives to acquire technology because it allows her to expedite the process. </p>
<p>"We don't have to go out for bid when a product is already on the buying consortium's contract," said Walden, who most recently worked with the <a href="http://paec.org/" target="_blank">Panhandle Area Educational Consortium</a> (PAEC) in Chipley, FL to purchase about 250 Acer laptops. (PAEC works with the AEPA to secure lower prices for its members.) Currently in the process of getting that purchase approved by the school board, Walden said working with the buying group is as simple as "making the vendor aware that we wanted to use the public purchasing program." </p>
