<p><a href="http://www.brocade.com/" target="_blank">Brocade</a>, a networking provider for data 
centers, has introduced a new distributed chassis solution based on the
<a href="http://www.brocade.com/products/all/switches/product-details/icx-7750-switch/features.page" target="_blank">
Brocade ICX 7750</a>; a new enterprise campus stackable switch, the
<a href="http://www.brocade.com/products/all/switches/product-details/icx-7450-switch/index.page" target="_blank">

<a href="https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/onf-specifications/openflow" target="_blank">

<p>According to the company, these additions to Brocade's "<a href="http://www.brocade.com/launch/effortless-network/" target="_blank">Effortless 
Network</a>" strategy will help campuses "transform their edge networks to 
support mobility, social and cloud data traffic as they transition to the New 
IP," or virtualized Internet protocol  network. Specifically, the new 
Brocade ICX 7450 is designed to support applications such as video conferencing 
and virtual desktop infrastructure and to deliver power to high-definition 
displays directly from the switch.</p>
