<p><a href="http://www.holycrosshs-ct.com/" target="_blank">Holy Cross High School</a>, a
private school located in Waterbury, CT, has implemented a wireless network to
serve more than 650 students, faculty, staff and guests.</p>
<p>According to Tim McDonald, president of the school, different groups of
people in the school access the Internet "at different times in the day, on
different devices in a variety of different places in the building," and the
school wanted a provider that could tailor a solution to meet the school's
complex needs.</p>
<p>They worked with <a href="http://www.resolutepartners.com/" target="_blank">Resolute
Partners</a>, a company that engineers, installs, operates and maintains
Internet access and wireless networks for schools and other organizations.
Resolute's engineers conducted an on-site review to "determine the best
hardware and locations that would deliver the required level of Wi-Fi coverage
in specified areas throughout the school," according to information from the
company. As part of the site review process, Resolute considered the school's
coverage and capacity requirements, the type of technology students were using
and the school's future plans.</p>

<p>Based on that site review, the school decided to proceed with the
implementation. The process involved installing fiber optic cabling,
identifying intermediate distribution facility (IDF) locations, installing
wireless access points and upgrading the network backbone. Once the hardware
implementation was complete, Resolute configured the network, including its
service set IDs (SSID) and virtual local area networks (VLANs), and tested the
entire setup.</p>
<p>The entire project took less than six weeks to complete and according to
McDonald, the students, faculty and staff at the school are enjoying the new
wireless network and the ability to access educational resources from their
mobile devices.</p>
