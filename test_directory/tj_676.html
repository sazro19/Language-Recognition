<p>The Twin Cities campus of the University of Minnesota will be hosting a <a href="http://moodle.com/" target="_blank">Moodle</a> conference sponsored by the main organization behind the Moodle project. "<a href="https://mootus15.moodlemoot.org/" target="_blank">MoodleMoot US</a>" will run Aug. 4-6 in Minneapolis and feature Moodle founder Martin Dougiamas as well as speakers from higher ed and K-12 sharing how they use  open source tools, including the Moodle open source course management system, in education.</p>
<p>Dougiamas wrote his Ph.D. thesis on the use of open source software to support teaching and learning and eventually developed a free content management system that evolved into Moodle. He was instrumental in persuading the U.S. Patent Office to revoke a patent it had issued to Blackboard, which had claimed it had created the first Internet-based education support system. Dougiamas currently serves as the lead developer of Moodle, through an organization based in Western Australia.</p>
<p>"A MoodleMoot is where the community comes together to share and grow technical and design skills, network with friends, exchange best practices and drive the Moodle project forward" said Dougiamas in a prepared statement. The August gathering is the first "official" Moodle event in the United States, he noted.</p>

<p>After the conference ends, organizers will be running a one-day "hackfest," where developer participants will work together on future Moodle improvements using specifications from <a href="https://mootus15.moodlemoot.org/mod/page/view.php?id=25" target="_blank">Moodle working groups</a> and other sources.</p>
<p>Besides Dougiamas, other notable speakers will include David Ernst, CIO for U Minnesota's <a href="http://www.cehd.umn.edu/" target="_blank">College of Education and Human Development</a> and director for the <a href="http://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/" target="_blank">Open Textbook Network</a>; and Charlie Reisinger, IT director at <a href="http://www.pennmanor.net/" target="_blank">Penn Manor School District</a>, which, in 2013, launched Pennsylvania's largest high school 1-to-1 program using Linux and open source software.</p>
<p>Early-bird registration for the event ends June 30.</p>
