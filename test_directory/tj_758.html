<p>Allowing students to bring their own devices into the classroom is a relatively new concept to many U.S. school districts. BYOD can help personalize learning by letting students work on devices that they are very familiar with, but it also creates some key challenges for the IT professionals who have to balance the need for computing power with the resources provided by their districts. Here, a handful of district technology heads discuss their BYOD best practices and suggest how others might adopt them. </p>
<p><strong>1) Don’t substitute a BYOD program for a 1-to-1 computing initiative.</strong> While the two concepts may seem similar from the CTO’s perspective, lumping them together can be a mistake. According to Bob Gravina, CIO at <a href="http://www.powayusd.com"><strong>Poway Unified School District</strong></a> in San Diego, “We look at BYOD as an <em>addition</em> to our 1-to-1 initiative, and not as a replacement for every student having access to a device while in school.”</p>

<p><strong>2) Invest in wireless networks <em>and</em></strong><strong> the technology infrastructure to support them.</strong> Here’s one instance where the “if you build it, they will come” approach actually works. Gravina said, “When we saw the popularity of laptops and mobile devices among students and teachers, we started building out a network to be able to support those devices.” </p>
<p>That effort has been ongoing over the last 10 years at Poway USD, whose goal is to support three to four devices per student. To achieve that mission, the district built a robust wireless network and invested in switches, access points and other infrastructure components to support that network. “You can’t just put a lot of money into wireless without the bandwidth, or vice versa,” said Gravina. “You really need to do both.”</p>
<p><strong>3) Shoot for a K-12 BYOD initiative. </strong>When <a href="http://www.meridenk12.org"><strong>Meriden Public Schools</strong></a> (CT) wrapped up a successful six-week BYOD pilot in 2014, one of the first questions that came up was, “Do we now roll this out to all students in grades K-12, or just some of them?” </p>
<p>Both Barbara Haeffner, director of curriculum and instructional technology for the 9,000-student district, and Superintendent Mark Benigni said they wanted a districtwide initiative. According to Benigni, “We felt that even our K-5 pupils would benefit from the rollout, regardless of whether they were actively using devices daily in class. So while these younger students may not benefit as much from the BYOD as our secondary schools would, we wanted to send a message that they will in time.” </p>
<p>Haeffner said that simple message opened the door for elementary teachers to embrace some level of technology and encourage students to bring devices into the classroom. “We wanted to make sure that everyone saw this as a K-12 transition,” she said, “and not just as a secondary-school initiative.”</p>
<p><strong>4) Develop a robust cloud network that all stakeholders can use to access key materials and applications.</strong> As part of its commitment to BYOD, Poway USD rolled out a single-sign-on, cloud-based portal that students, teachers, staff and parents can access online on a 24/7 basis. Users can view attendance records, test scores, grades, homework, digital textbooks and other materials in real time, according to Gravina. The portal also serves as an e-mail exchange and enables single sign-on for Google Docs and Khan Academy curriculum materials and videos. “It’s both a private network and a public cloud,” said Gravina, “where everyone can access all of their resources on a centralized platform.”</p>
