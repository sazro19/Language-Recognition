<p><a href="http://www.desire2learn.com/" target="_blank">Desire2Learn</a> is using  the stage of its annual user conference, <a href="https://fusion.desire2learn.com/fusion/" target="_blank">Fusion 2014</a>, to shorten its  moniker and announce a new branding for its  education applications. The  company is now simply going by <a href="http://www.d2l.com/" target="_blank">D2L</a> and its  flagship product set will be called <a href="http://www.brightspace.com/" target="_blank">Brightspace</a>.  D2L is also doing a dramatic refresh of its software, including integration of  several technologies acquired over the last year and teaming up with IBM and  Microsoft for additional offerings. It is also shifting away from using the common  term "learning management system" or LMS to describe its wares, now referencing  them as an "integrated learning platform" or ILP.</p>
<p>According to President and CEO John Baker, a typical LMS "is  just a management system: Here's who should be learning what, here's what they're  learning, and really focused on the management tasks." An ILP, on the  other hand, while including management components, also takes on "the  biggest challenges there for education — everything from improving retention  rates to improving graduation rates to helping people accelerate their learning  to really getting students engaged and inspired to driving adoption," he  explained. "These are all big challenges. Just putting content online is  not going to cut it anymore."</p>

<p>The latest version of Brightspace strengthens the adaptive  learning aspects of the program by building in an adaptive learning engine,  which combines technology from the company's September 2013 acquisition of <a href="http://www.knowillage.com/" target="_blank">Knowillage Systems</a> and Learning Path  (LeaP) and the <a href="http://asn.jesandco.org/" target="_blank">Achievement Standards Network</a>,  whose support was taken on by D2L in March 2014. LeaP allows an instructor to  personalize learning for each student. The Standards Network is a digital  repository of 400,000 education standards. The new engine can automatically  create a "knowledge map" laying out adaptive pathways for each  student. When they struggle with a concept, they can dive into digital  curriculum again and again, until they understand it. "It could even  include things like publisher content, open content, like <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a> or other resources,"  Baker said. "We've built a ton of new technology to support fully  automating the adaptive learning generation."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.desire2learn.com/products/mobile/binder/" target="_blank">Binder</a>,  D2L's e-book and digital course material platform, is also getting a remake.  The company is working with Microsoft to offer a version of Binder for <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/meet" target="_blank">Windows 8</a> alongside iOS and Android devices. (The software is also available in an HTML5  version.) The new app, expected in September 2014, will allow students to "consume,  organize, and annotate" e-books, course content and learning materials on  any Windows 8 device.</p>
<p>On top of that, D2L has expanded the number of publishing companies  that participate in Binder. The original list, <a href="http://www.cengage.com/us/" target="_blank">Cengage  Learning</a> and <a href="http://www.mheducation.com/" target="_blank">McGraw-Hill  Education</a>, also now  includes <a href="http://www.macmillan.com/" target="_blank">Macmillan</a>, <a href="http://www.nelson.com/" target="_blank">Nelson Education</a> and <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/" target="_blank">Wiley</a>. These agreements let students to buy and  rent e-books on the Web and through Binder, which can be tied into Brightspace.  Baker noted that the platform could expand to include an additional 65  publishers by this fall.<strong></strong></p>
<p>The company announced that it would also be embedding the <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/analytics/cognos/" target="_blank">Cognos</a> engine, IBM's  business intelligence software, into its data analytics application, <a href="http://www.desire2learn.com/products/insights/" target="_blank">D2L Insights</a>. Insights  provides information about learning outcomes, student engagement and enrollment metrics and  student grades to guide instructor and administration activities. The IBM  integration will enable schools to combine classroom data with enterprise data  for new views into the composition of student success.</p>
