<p>The <a href="http://www.iste.org/">International Society for Technology in Education</a> (ISTE) is seeking feedback and recommendations on the second draft of its Standards for Teachers. ISTE is inviting input from the global education technology community through Feb. 28.</p>
<p>The teacher standards “refresh” is intended to be open and inclusive. To help educators participate in the process, ISTE is providing a free toolkit to host feedback forums, an individual response survey and an easy way for educators to share information about the refresh. The toolkit includes a facilitator’s guide, surveys for gathering feedback and annotated presentation slides. More information is available on ISTE’s <a href="http://www.iste.org/standards/standards/for-teachers-refresh-2016-lp">Teacher Refresh page</a>.</p>
<p>The ISTE Standards provide a framework for learning, teaching and leading that is amplified by technology. These digital age standards are not “technology standards,” but a road map for educators worldwide as they navigate decisions about curriculum, instruction, professional learning and how to transform pedagogy with technology. These standards are refreshed every seven to 10 years to ensure they remain relevant and continue to prepare students for the future while also allowing schools, districts and states to have time to adopt, implement and show an impact on learning.</p>

<li>Streamlining and simplifying the language;</li>
<li>The Citizen Standard (No. 3) now includes an indicator designed to address critical consumption of media, such as resources that appear to be news; and</li>

</ul>
<p>The refreshed teacher standards will be released in June 2017 at the <a href="http://conference.iste.org/2017/">ISTE Conference &amp; Expo</a>, June 25-28 in San Antonio, TX. At that time, ISTE will begin the refresh process for the ISTE Standards for Administrators.</p>
