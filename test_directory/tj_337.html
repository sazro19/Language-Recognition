<p>Beginning this summer, <a href="http://futureready.org/" target="_blank">Future Ready Schools</a> (FRS) will host <a href="http://futureready.org/frs-institutes/" target="_blank">eight learning institutes</a> that offer personal professional development opportunities for district leaders, IT directors, principals, teachers, instructional coaches, librarians and media specialists planning to implement personalized learning strategies for their students.</p>
<p>The two-day FRS institutes are completely free, thanks to sponsorship by FRS’ partners <a href="https://www.follett.com/" target="_blank">Follett</a>, <a href="http://www.mheducation.com/" target="_blank">McGraw Hill Education</a>, <a href="http://www.pearsoned.com/" target="_blank">Pearson Education</a> and <a href="http://info.summitlearning.org/" target="_blank">Summit Learning</a>. They revolve around the <a href="https://dashboard.futurereadyschools.org/framework" target="_blank">FRS framework</a> and participants will learn to use the <a href="https://dashboard.futurereadyschools.org/" target="_blank">FRS interactive planning dashboard tool</a>, a free online tool used by about 900 school districts, as well as the <a href="http://dashboard.futurereadyschools.org/5steps" target="_blank">FRS five-step planning process</a> to ensure a successful digital conversation. Afterwards, each institute will launch a regional network to provide ongoing support and host follow-up activities “to ensure districts have the resources needed to create customized, actionable personalized learning plans,” according to information from FRS. </p>
