<p>Worldwide  device shipments, including mobile phones, PCs, tablets and unltramobiles, will  increase 4.2 percent this year over last to reach 2.4 billion units, according  to the latest forecast from market research firm <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/home.jsp" target="_blank">Gartner</a>.</p>
<p>That  growth will be enabled, in part, "by a relative revival of the global PC  market," according to Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner. PC  shipments, which include desktop, notebook and premium ultramobile devices,  declined 9.5 percent in 2013, but are on pace to contract by only 2.9 percent  this year, according to the company.</p>
<p>Traditional  PCs, which include desktops and notebooks, will continue to drop more quickly,  declining 6.7 percent this year and 5.3 percent in 2015, according to the  company.</p>
<p>"Business upgrades from Windows XP and the  general business replacement cycle will lessen the downward trend, especially  in Western Europe," said Atwal, in a prepared statement. "This year,  we anticipate nearly 60 million professional PC replacements in mature markets."</p>

<p>Premium ultramobiles only make up a small share  of the segment, but will improve from approximately 21.5 million units in 2013  to more than 32 million this year and about 55 million next year, according to  the forecast.</p>
<p>Mobile  phones will once again represent more than three-quarters of all device  shipments this year, with 1.86  billion shipments in 2014 and 2.59 billion in 2015, according to Gartner. The  66 percent market share currently controlled by smartphones will improve to 88  percent in 2018, according to a news release.</p>
<p>Tablet sales will also improve, from 206.8  million in 2013 to 256.3 million and 320.9 million this year and  next, respectively.</p>
<p>"As with any devices, adoption goes  through phases from the early to the late adopter; tablets are currently moving  onto the latter part of that curve in mature markets," according to a news  release. "Gartner estimates that sales of tablets will see a relative  slowdown in 2014 to reach 256 million units, an increase of 23.9 percent from  2013. Lower demand from users for tablets with smaller screens, some in favor  of larger screens, in mature markets, and the shift towards phablets in  South-East Asia are slowing global tablet penetration."</p>
<p>"The next wave of adoption will be driven  by lower price points rather than superior functionality," said Atwal, in  a prepared statement.</p>
<p>"In the operating system (OS) market,  Android and iOS are driving the growth with a 30 percent and 15 percent  increase, respectively, in 2014," according to information released  by the company.</p>
<p>Android will again be the dominant operating system  in 2014, with Gartner projecting that nearly 1.2 billion devices sold this year  and 1.37 billion next year featuring the operating system.</p>
<p>Devices powered by Windows will remain a  distant second, moving approximately 333.4 million units this year and nearly  373.7 million next year.</p>
<p>Apple's iOS and Mac OS, in third place, will  improve from just more than 236 million shipments last year to about 271  million this year and more than 301 million in 2015, according to Gartner.</p>
<p>"We expect the announcement of the new  Apple iPhone 6 will attract pent-up demand for users who want a larger screen,"  said Annette Zimmermann, research director at Gartner, in a prepared statement.  "Windows phones will exhibit strong growth from a low base in 2014, and  are projected to reach a 10 percent market share by 2018 — up from 4 percent in  2014."</p>
