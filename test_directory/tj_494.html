<p>EBSCO has integrateded the Plum Print widget with its <a href="https://www.ebscohost.com/discovery" target="_blank">EBSCO Discovery Service</a> (EDS) and <a href="https://www.ebscohost.com/" target="_blank">EBSCOHost</a> databases in an effort to  offer users new research insights by viewing modern metrics.</p>
<p>The result of a partnership with the EBSCO-owned company <a href="http://plumanalytics.com/" target="_blank">Plum Analytics</a>, the new integration will  allow users "to visualize the research impact of all items in the results  list, including articles, books chapters, e-books, and institutional repository  materials," according to a news release. "Powered by the PlumX Suite,  the Plum Print visually changes depending on the altmetrics found in each of  the five categories: usage, captures, mentions, social media and citations,  providing added research insight at the artifact level."</p>
<p>The widget will appear in search results, giving users a  quick visual cue to help find information they're interested in. Hovering over  the widget will offer a visual breakdown of the altmetrics and clicking on it  will open the Plum Suite for more in depth information.</p>

<p>"As EBSCO moves forward as a technical innovator for  libraries and their institutions, we think altmetrics is an important component  for them," said Mark Herrick, senior vice president of business  development and strategy at EBSCO, in a prepared statement. "That  was our initial motivation in January 2014 when we acquired Plum Analytics.  Since that time we've done a lot of careful work, including a trial roll-out of  the Plum Print in our <a href="https://www.ebscohost.com/nursing/products/cinahl-databases/cinahl-complete" target="_blank">CINAHL</a> database, building a scalable infrastructure and gathering metrics for a very  large number of articles and other research artifacts to give users of EDS and  other databases an optimal experience."</p>
