<p>The worldwide market for business process management (BPM) software is
expected to reach $2.7 billion in 2015, an increase of 4.4 percent over 2014,
according to the information technology research and advisory company <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/home.jsp" target="_blank">Gartner</a>.</p>
<p>The reason for this growth is the move to intelligent business process
management suites (iBPMS), according to Gartner. Organizations are shifting
their business models and processes to be more responsive to their
constituents. To support that shift, they need systems that are more flexible
and dynamic.</p>
<p>"The ability to provide more 'joined up' insight into business processes
through the use of analytics — combined with support for the people
involved in processes, allowing them to take advantage of this insight —
is what differentiates today's iBPMS market from earlier BPMS technology
markets," said Rob Dunie, research director at Gartner, in a prepared
statement.</p>
<p>Gartner identified four significant trends in the iBPMS market:</p>

<li>The shift from continuous process improvement to business transformation
    in response to both internal and external forces, as well as a push for
    greater efficiency;</li>

    with advanced analytics technology, such as pattern recognition and
    predictive analytics to support process innovation;</li>
<li>A shift from short-lived, transactional system-oriented processes to
    long-lived processes that include people, systems and functional
    boundaries; and</li>

    more system and human intelligence within business processes.</li>
