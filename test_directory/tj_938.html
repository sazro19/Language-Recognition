<p><a href="http://www.lexialearning.com">Lexia Reading Core5</a>, a technology-based reading program designed for pre-K through fifth grade, is now available as an <a href="http://tinyurl.com/l96cr5s">Android app</a>. Downloadable from the Google Play store, the new app allows students to use Lexia Reading Core5 on phones and tablets running Android 2.3 and higher. </p>
<p>Lexia Reading Core5 is designed to accelerate the development of fundamental literacy skills for students of all abilities through personalized learning paths with scaffolding and explicit instruction that support students if they struggle. Each of the age-appropriate, skill-specific activities conforms to state standards, including the Common Core. </p>
<p>The program also includes Lexia’s proprietary Assessment Without Testing technology, which can be used by educators to reduce dependence on traditional testing methods. The embedded assessment technology gathers student performance data without administering a test, using norm-referenced measurements that are correlated to student outcomes on commonly used measures such as DIBELS and AIMSweb.  </p>
