<p>Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) has been innovating in recent years, and now the latest addition to <a href="http://www.dell.com/" target="_blank">Dell</a>’s thin client series boasts improved performance that makes it comparable to the company’s mainstream platforms and PCs. The company on Tuesday unveiled its lightest, smallest and most power-efficient thin client yet, the <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/wyse-t-class/pd" target="_blank">Wyse 3040</a>.</p>
<p>Starting at $329, the Wyse 3040 thin client is part of the “value” 3000 series. Positioned at the entry level, Wyse 3040 boasts high-performance features such as a full Intel quad-core processor. </p>
<p>“We’ve built [the Intel quad-core processor] into this thin client as an industry first,” said Jeff McNaught, VP of marketing at <a href="http://www.dell.com/en-us/work/learn/virtual-client" target="_blank">Dell Cloud Client-Computing</a>, an arm of Dell focused on VDI, cloud client-computing and other next-generation technologies. “The reason that we’ve done that is we want thin clients to stay on the desktop, not for the three to five years you would typically hope a PC would stay on the desktop before it gets replaced, but for eight to 10 years.” </p>

<p>McNaught, who worked at Wyse Technologies as an engineer and co-invented Wyse thin clients, said that Wyse 3040 meets the following three big requirements for thin clients specifically for education customers: It displays <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/" target="_blank">Windows</a> applications and video really well; delivers great sound and audio capability; and offers reliable unified communications (web and audio conferencing like <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/skype-for-business/compare-plans?wt.srch=1&amp;wt.mc_id=AID522514_SEM_5SgP1hTH" target="_blank">Skype for Business</a>). </p>
<p>“Most of thin clients at the entry level can not do all those things, but this is the first product that can,” said McNaught.</p>
<p>Its enhanced capabilities come from the quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM and 8GB of storage, as well as the virus-resistant operating system WyzeThinOS 8.3.2. “In the entire history of the WyzeThinOS, no customer has reported a successful hacking of it,” McNaught commented. </p>
<p>On top of these features, Dell has put in four USB ports (three USB 2 ports and one USB 3.1 Gen 1), allowing the Wyse 3040 to support up to four different devices simultaneously and offer high-speed connections. The new model also has two DisplayPorts on the back, providing full digital support for two high-res displays. </p>
<p>Wyse 3040 was designed for efficiency, boasting a 30 percent improvement in performance over previous models, while using about 25 percent less energy — 2.5 watts, or roughly a third of the energy used by a single Christmas tree light bulb. </p>
<p>Wyse 3040 can be mounted on the back of a display, on the side of a desk or under a tabletop, so that it’s out of the way for users. </p>
<p>Other key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dimensions: 4 inches x 4 inches x 1.5 inches;</li>
<li>Display: Performance for Citrix, Microsoft or VMWare digital workspaces across two displays (2560 x 1600 at 60 Hz);</li>
<li>Operating System: Choose between multiple operating systems including Wyse ThinOS, Windows Embedded, ThinLinux, and zero clients;</li>
<li>Compatible with all major virtualization software brokers, including Citrix XenDesktop, Microsoft RDS and VMWare Horizon; and</li>
<li>Supports Citrix HDX, Microsoft RDP and PCoIP protocols and will support VMware Blast Extreme remote protocol starting June 2017.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the cost-effective endpoint solution is efficient, secure and easy to deploy and manage for IT teams across high-regulated industries like education, healthcare, government, retail, finance and manufacturing, according to a company statement.</p>
