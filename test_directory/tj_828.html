<p>A higher-order thinker is a critical thinker. What are the attributes of a critical thinker? In <em><a href="http://www.criticalthinking.org/store/products/critical-thinking-concepts-amp-tools/156">The Miniature Guide to Critical Thinking Concepts and Tools</a></em>, Richard Paul and Linda Elder describe a well-cultivated critical thinker as someone who:</p>
<ul>
<li>raises vital questions and problems, formulating them clearly and precisely;</li>
<li>gathers and assesses relevant information, using abstract ideas to interpret it effectively; </li>
<li>comes to well-reasoned conclusions and solutions, testing them against relevant criteria and standards;</li>
<li>thinks open-mindedly within alternative systems of thought, recognizing and assessing their assumptions, implications and practical consequences as need be; and</li>
<li>communicates effectively with others in figuring out solutions to complex problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>How can the use of apps on an iOS or Android tablet help teachers develop these critical thinking skills in students? Concentrating on apps that can target the cognitive thinking skills at the high end of Bloom’s Revised Taxonomy (2000) is one way to work on this process.</p>
<p>Since many schools now have BYOD programs, finding apps that are available for both the iOS and Android operating systems makes it easier for teachers to develop formative and summative assessments that all students can complete. If educators are familiar with what the creative tool is capable of, they are more likely to develop engaging and meaningful assessments as well as provide technical support for their students. Educators should first re-familiarize themselves with the concepts inherent in the higher-order thinking skills of Bloom’s Revised Taxonomy.</p>
<p><strong>HOTS Levels of Bloom’s</strong></p>
<p><strong>Analyzing</strong> includes breaking information into parts to explore understandings and relationships. Apps that fit into the "analyzing" stage improve the user's ability to differentiate between the relevant and irrelevant, determine relationships, and recognize the organization of content. When analyzing, students complete tasks that involve structuring, surveying, outlining and organizing.</p>
<p>The <strong>evaluating</strong> level has students making decisions about the value of content based on criteria set by themselves or external sources. Apps at this stage help students judge content reliability and accuracy, quality and effectiveness. They also help students reach informed decisions. In evaluating, students show their understanding of a topic or participate in evaluating a peer’s understanding of a topic.</p>
<p>The <strong>creating</strong> level helps students reorganize acquired knowledge and information to create a new end result. Apps at this level provide opportunities for students to generate ideas, design plans and come up with a new way of doing things. Creative projects can involve video editing, storytelling, videocasting, podcasting or animating. </p>
<p><strong>Integrating Apps Into Instruction</strong></p>
<p>Showcasing apps out of the context of the instructional process is not very helpful. Pedagogy should always come first, and the tool second. The following activity begins with students watching a <a href="file://localhost/watch">video</a> that tells a story. I’ll then offer two sample assessments of each of the three highest levels of Bloom’s Revised Taxonomy, as well as an app for each assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Analyzing assessment 1: </strong>Outline the relationship between implicit and explicit themes in the video.<br/>
<strong>Assessment type</strong>: Mind/concept map<br/>
<strong>App</strong>: Mindomo (free for <a href="file://localhost/us/app/mindomo-mind-mapping/id526684279">iOS</a> and <a href="file://localhost/store/apps/details">Android</a>)</p>
