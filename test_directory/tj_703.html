<p>The story of <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2014/11/21/how-to-botch-a-tech-rollout.aspx">Los Angeles Unified School District's beleaguered $1.3 billion 1-to-1 iPad program</a> has taken a new twist: The district is now demanding a refund from Apple and has told the company it will not spend any more money on the Pearson software installed on the devices, according to reports.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/04/15/51027/lausd-ipad-program-ditching-pearson-software-reque/" target="_blank">According to Southern California Public Radio</a>, which broke the story yesterday, the school district's attorney, David Holmquist, wrote a letter to Apple's general counsel claiming that Apple and Pearson had failed to deliver on the promise of "a state-of-the-art technological solution for [the district's Instructional Technology Initiative] implementation" and noted that the district is "extremely dissatisfied" with the solution in its present form. Further, SCPR reported, the district "is seeking a multi-million-dollar refund" from Apple and could take the company to court, should an agreement not be reached.</p>

<p>Following a number of serious issues, LAUSD's massive 650,000-student 1-to-1 iPad deployment was <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2015/02/23/la-unified-reverses-1to1-direction.aspx" target="_blank">put on hold last summer</a>, by which time some 120,000 iPads had already been purchased. Capping off the troubles for the program, this fall the <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2014/12/03/ipad-deployments-to-continue-at-los-angeles-district-in-time-for-testing.aspx" target="_blank">FBI stepped in to begin an investigation</a> into the  process by which Pearson and Apple were selected as vendors for the initiative.</p>
<p>Pearson spokesperson Stacy Skelly told <em>THE Journal</em>: "Pearson is proud of our long history working with LAUSD and our significant investment in this groundbreaking initiative to transform instructional practices and raise expectations for all students. This was a large-scale implementation of new technologies and there have been challenges with the initial adoption, but we stand by the quality of our performance."</p>
<p> Apple did not respond to  requests for comment by press time.</p>
