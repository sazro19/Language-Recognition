<p>The <a href="https://www.coloradoea.org/" target="_blank">Colorado Education Association</a> (CEA) is embedding video observation and feedback into its online professional development (PD) platform called <a href="https://www.ceacopilot.org/" target="_blank">COpilot</a>.</p>
<p>The statewide federation CEA — comprised of 35,000 K–12 teachers and education support professionals, higher education faculty and support professionals, retired educators and college students studying to become teachers — launched COpilot last February to give its members access to online classes with peer-to-peer teacher support. The CEA is the <a href="https://www.coloradoea.org/content/%E2%80%9Cteachers-teaching-teachers%E2%80%9D-takes-flight-colorado-copilot" target="_blank">first state affiliate</a> of the <a href="http://www.nea.org/" target="_blank">National Education Association</a> to roll out such a platform.</p>
<p>COpilot now offers <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2017/05/16/u-of-colorado-denver-teacher-training-program-turns-to-video.aspx" target="_blank">video-powered PD</a> through <a href="https://www.edthena.com/" target="_blank">Edthena</a>. Educators can use the platform to upload videos of their classroom instruction and then share those videos with coaches who can give timestamped comments categorized as questions, suggestions, strengths and notes. </p>

<p>“With Edthena, teachers who are taking classes on COpilot can collaborate with each other in a unique and personalized way, which is something many of them have never experienced,” wrote Casey Kilpatrick, dir	ector of learning services at the CEA, in the <a href="https://blog.edthena.com/2017/08/02/cea-teachers-union-video-coaching-professional-development/" target="_blank">blog post announcement</a>. “Edthena really is the best video coaching platform we looked at. It adds cutting-edge technology to our teachers’ experience.”</p>
<p>Several Colorado educators presented on Edthena integration at the recent Colorado Education Association Leadership Conference, which can be seen below. Further information is available on the <a href="https://blog.edthena.com/2017/08/02/cea-teachers-union-video-coaching-professional-development/" target="_blank">Edthena blog</a>. </p>
