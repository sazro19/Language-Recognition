<p>Traditional PCs are continuing to see growth worldwide despite bottlenecks in the supply chain. However, according to a new report from market research firm <a href="https://www.idc.com/" target="_blank">IDC</a>, in the United States, traditional PCs saw their first quarterly decline since the beginning of the pandemic. Traditional PCs include desktops, notebooks and workstations.</p>
<p>"Bottlenecked supply chains and ongoing logistic challenges led the U.S. PC market into its first quarter of annual shipment decline since the beginning of the pandemic," said Neha Mahajan, senior research analyst, Devices and Displays at IDC, in a prepared statement. "After a year of accelerated buying driven by the shift to remote work and learning, there’s also been a comparative slowdown in PC spending and that has caused some softening of the U.S. PC market today. Yet, supply clearly remains behind demand in key segments with inventory still below normal levels."</p>
<p>Interestingly, according to IDC, vendors witched their "shipping priorities" during the quarter, sending units to emerging markets where growth is strong and holding back in markets (countries) with slower growth.</p>
