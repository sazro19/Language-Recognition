<p><a href="http://www.extremenetworks.com/" target="_blank">Extreme Networks</a> has  updated its network management tool, <a href="http://www.extremenetworks.com/product/management-center/" target="_blank">Extreme  Management Center</a> (EMC), with new tools designed to improve onboarding and  security.</p>
<p>EMC is designed to deliver digital learning and features a dashboard  that offers data all the way down to the individual user, device, application  or policy.</p>
<p>The newest version, EMC 8.0, offers a new analytics dashboard with an improved  workflow with flexible groupings, filtering for reporting and large-scale  editing in the same place. The new dashboard offers capabilities that would have  required writing in Java from the IT staff in previous versions. IT staff can also  now onboard student Chromebooks using Google or Microsoft credentials. Version  8.0 also integrates the company's Information Governance Engine to  automatically analyze and secure network configurations for HIPPA and PCI  compliance.</p>
<p>"We're thrilled with the new enhancements to Extreme Management  Center 8.0," said David Monachino, network engineer at the <a href="https://www.dcsd.k12.nv.us/" target="_blank">Douglas County School District</a>, in a  prepared statement. "Our small IT staff had been stretched to keep up with  the latest ed tech trends, and these new capabilities provide the best level of  control and visibility that we were looking for in order to support our school's  1:1 computing and BYOD programs, especially during online testing periods."</p>
