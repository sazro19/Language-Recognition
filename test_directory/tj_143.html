<p>A new  report from the <a href="http://www.setda.org/" target="_blank">State Educational Technology Directors Association  (SETDA)</a> found that  while many states have figured out how to share multiple sources of education  data to reduce manual data entry or improve data consistency, they still  struggle to use data "to present a full picture of student learning."</p>
<p>"<a href="http://www.setda.org/priorities/interoperability/stateleadership/" target="_blank">State Education Leadership for  Interoperability: Leveraging Data for Academic Excellence</a>" profiled the data  interoperability work of nine states to understand the challenges they've faced  in their data usage efforts as well as the benefits.</p>
<p>This isn't  the first time the organization has tackled the topic of data interoperability.  In 2013 SETDA <a href="http://www.setda.org/priorities/interoperability/data-to-information/" target="_blank">released a report to examine the  major K-12 data standards and interoperability initiatives</a> underway at that time. (Full  disclosure: This reporter helped produce that report.) Since then some of those  efforts  —  inBloom  —  have gone by the wayside. What hasn't changed is the need  for districts and educators to get access to certain kinds of data for  accountability work, guiding instructional decisions and doing school  administration and operations.</p>

<p>As the  report noted, data interoperability has many use cases. It's useful for student  information handover related to transcripts, attendance and discipline; support  for "data backpacks," that preserve information about student  progress and can transfer data from one learning management system to another;  and accumulation of digital "learning objects" into a class, grade,  school or district repository for quick access.</p>
<p>Among the  challenges states and districts face in their data exchange work is a lack of  understanding about the importance of interoperability, inconsistency of standards  and lack of access to data in a usable format, and an inability to communicate  why data exchange is important for student learning. "Convincing teachers  that using data to personalize learning will be easier and reduce their burden  can be difficult," the report stated.</p>
<p>The report  offered numerous recommendations. The first one is using implementation of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) as an "opportunity" to expand  interoperability efforts. For example, Michigan's state plan for ESSA directly  links goals to the need for interoperability; that's tied to legislative  priorities that call for the "seamless transmission of data from the  districts to the state and back ... with minimal effort and duplication."</p>
<p>The  establishment of a data governance structure within the state department of  education is also important, according to the report, to put rails along the  process of collecting, security and ensuring the quality of data.</p>
<p>Collaboration  with districts also gets a nod, even for "local control" states. By  including districts in planning related to interoperability, states will help  them with their procurement process; districts will be able to choose  applications that go beyond compliance with federal and state reporting to  incorporate the use of data for meeting student learning goals too.</p>
<p>"Research  like this supports the entire interoperability movement, and we were happy to  share our own successes and challenges to serve a larger purpose," said  Patches Hill, director and chief information officer for technology operations  at the <a href="https://www.doe.k12.de.us/" target="_blank">Delaware Department of Education</a>, which was profiled in the report.  "Without an interoperability implementation plan and buy-in from  stakeholders, it is difficult to maximize the use of data for student learning.  This report will help address that gap."</p>
<p>"SETDA  has done an excellent job of pulling together many different perspectives and  voices to deliver this valuable resource to their members," added Maureen  Wentworth, manager of strategic partnerships at the <a href="https://www.ed-fi.org/" target="_blank">Ed-Fi  Alliance</a>.  "The report captures the current state of play in the ed tech market, the  challenges and benefits of bringing interoperability to state education  agencies and a clear outline of the resources state leaders might use to begin  their own journey towards interoperability practices."</p>
<p>The work  was supported through funding from the <a href="https://www.msdf.org/" target="_blank">Michael &amp; Susan Dell Foundation</a> and in partnership with the Ed-Fi  Alliance.</p>
