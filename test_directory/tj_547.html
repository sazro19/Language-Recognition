<p>A joint project has uncovered how K-12 organizations and community colleges can tap into identity federations to take advantage of  shared online services. A task force made up of <a href="http://www.internet2.edu/" target="_blank">Internet2</a>, <a href="https://www.incommon.org/" target="_blank">InCommon</a>, <a href="http://www.thequilt.net/" target="_blank">The Quilt</a>, <a href="http://www.educause.edu/" target="_blank">Educause</a> and <a href="http://www.cosn.org/" target="_blank">CoSN</a> ran a set of pilot programs specifically to understand how they could extend  trust and identity solutions developed for higher education into these other  communities.</p>
<p>Internet2 is a community of academic, research, government  and industry entities that undertake research and development in technology  areas for the benefit of all their members. InCommon, operated by Internet2,  provides a common trust framework for education and research in the United  States that allows different organizations to share online access to their resources.  The Quilt is a coalition of 36 advanced regional networks used for research and  education. Educause is a member organization of IT leaders in higher ed. And  the Consortium for School Networking is a similar organization for K-12 IT  leaders.</p>

<p>The project gained steam in 2013 when The Quilt and InCommon  hosted a workshop in K-14 federation. From that initial gathering a group of  regional networks in Illinois, North Carolina, Maryland, Michigan, Nebraska,  Ohio, Utah and Wisconsin signed on to run pilot programs, each with its own set  of goals.</p>
<p>For example, in North Carolina the initial goal was to see  how <a href="http://www.davie.k12.nc.us/schools/early-college/" target="_blank">Davie County  Schools Early College High School</a> students could access resources available  from <a href="https://www.davidsonccc.edu/" target="_blank">Davidson County Community College</a> without having to manage two different sets of credentials. Longer term, the  regional network expects to develop similar opportunities between early college  programs and in-state college admissions applications.</p>
<p>In Utah the <a href="https://www.sedck12.org/" target="_blank">Southwest  Educational Development Center</a>, a regional provider, wanted its six  districts to be able to tap into services already provided by the <a href="http://uetn.org/" target="_blank">Utah Education and Telehealth Network</a> related to  password resets and other authentication related issues in order to preserve  its staff time for "other more technically demanding needs."</p>
<p>In <a href="https://spaces.internet2.edu/download/attachments/36701388/QuiltInCommonK-14IdentityFederationPilotProgram-WhitePaper.pdf" target="_blank">a  whitepaper that summarizes the results of the pilot programs</a>, the  participants concluded that K-12 organizations and community colleges could  benefit from simplified access to shared online services, but they often lack  the resources ("people, time and funding") they need to implement  federated identity solutions. That problem is compounded by the complexity of  the K-12 environment, where there are many schools within a single district  compared to higher ed, where the federation is happening within a single  institution.</p>
<p>Other problems surfaced, such as a wide variance in the "availability  and suitability" of district directory systems; or the applications they  wished to use weren't SAML-compliant, preventing them from using this standard  to exchange user authentication or authorization data; or the applications and  services available simply didn't interest the districts. Finally, all of the  pilot participants were concerned about privacy, security and federal  regulations that apply to their students and needed to figure out how those  areas might affect their pilots.</p>
<p>Participating in an identity federation has significant  benefits for educational institutions, the organizers reported, because that  approach provides a common framework for trusted shared management of access to  online resources. In the long term, such usage could help reduce staff, lower  service integration costs, increase security and give students ease of access.</p>
<p>"Federation is not easy. It's not something school  districts or community colleges should undertake without help," the report  concluded. "Regionals that are committed to working with their  constituents to provide guidance and support can be a major asset in enabling  federated solutions for K-14 institutions." The report's authors also  recommended that school districts and regional service providers draw on help  from local colleges and universities as well as commercial vendors that  specialize in establishing federation entities and custom integrations."</p>
<p>The results of each pilot and related documents are  available <a href="https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/InCQuiltFed/Home" target="_blank">on an  InCommon/Quilt Federation wiki</a>. On March 9, 2016, InCommon will host <a href="http://www.incommon.org/iamonline/#quilt" target="_blank">a webinar</a> that shares the  results of the pilot program.</p>
