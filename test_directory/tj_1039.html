<p>Google has announced a shortlist of 34 cities in nine metropolitan areas that 
could be next to receive <a href="https://fiber.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fiber</a>, 
and the company may also provide free gigabit Internet service to some schools 
in those cities.</p>
<p>Google Fiber is the company's fiber optic Internet infrastructure being 
implemented in select cities throughout the United States. According to 
information on the company's site, it provides connection speeds of up to 1 Gbps, also known as gigabit Internet, which is "100 times 
faster than today's basic broadband." Homes in the neighborhoods served by 
Google Fiber can subscribe to the company's gigabit Internet and TV services. 
The company also provides free basic Internet service of 5 Mbps download and 1 
Mbps upload speed to anybody in the areas served by Google Fiber.</p>
<p>Google Fiber is already in place in Kansas City and is set to roll out in 
Provo, UT and Austin, TX next. Cities on the shortlist for potential future 
rollouts include Atlanta, GA; Charlotte, NC; Nashville, TN; Salt Lake City, UT; 
San Antonio, TX; Phoenix, AZ; Portland, OR; Raleigh-Durham, NC and San Jose, CA.</p>
