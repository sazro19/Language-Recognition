<p>Spending on security for the internet of things (IoT) is projected to reach  $1.5 billion, up 28 percent over 2017's $1.2 billion, according to market research firm <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en" target="_blank">Gartner</a>.</p>
<p>Professional services will account for the bulk  of the spending throughout the forecast, at $946 million this year and growing  to $2.07 billion by the end of the forecast in 2021.</p>
<p>Endpoint security will follow, with $373 million in spending  this year, growing to $631 million in 2021.</p>
<p>Gateway security spending will increase from $186 million this  year to $415 million in the final year of the forecast.</p>
<p>Total spending in 2021, the final year of the forecast, is  projected to be about $3.12 billion.</p>
<p>Gartner also predicts that, despite steady growth, the industry  will be held back owing to a lack of implementation of security best practices  and prioritization, slowing spending growth by as much as 80 percent through  2020.</p>

<p>"Although IoT security is consistently  referred to as a primary concern, most IoT security implementations have been  planned, deployed and operated at the business-unit level, in cooperation with  some IT departments to ensure the IT portions affected by the devices are  sufficiently addressed," said Ruggero Contu, research director at  Gartner, in a prepared statement. "However, coordination via common  architecture or a consistent security strategy is all but absent, and vendor  product and service selection remains largely ad hoc, based upon the device  provider's alliances with partners or the core system that the devices are  enhancing or replacing."</p>
<p>Policy and design templates that would enable consistent reuse  of security features are not widespread and security standards are just  beginning to be addressed by standards bodies, industry alliances and other  organizations. These all stem from the lack of stringent regulations, according  to Gartner, but the company sees that changing by 2021, with regulations  becoming the main driver behind an increased focus on security in IoT by that  year.</p>
