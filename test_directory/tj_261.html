<p><em>THE Journal</em> spoke with Hargadon about social networking for educators, “unconferences” and hacking education.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> What is the Learning Revolution Project?  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Steve Hargadon:</strong> I started the first modern social network for educators called Classroom 2.0. <a href="https://www.ning.com" target="_blank">Ning</a> was a project for people to start their own social network.</p>
<p>When I started Classroom 2.0, I worked for Ning as a consultant. We started with tens of thousands of teachers in the network, and there was great value for teachers connecting with other teachers, students connecting with other students. It was a highly participative, collaborative work.</p>
<p>We started the <a href="http://www.globaleducationconference.com" target="_blank">Global Education Conference</a>, which was over five days, 24 hours a day, with over 60 keynotes. Rather than having small select groups and speakers, you could have lots of people participate with Classroom 2.0 and those online conferences. </p>
<p>This was pre-Facebook, pre-Twitter, with one of largest audiences of educators.<br/>
With my library audience, with museum curators and professionals, with homeschoolers, we created a space to talk about learning. </p>
<p>Intriguingly, one aspect of Facebook and Twitter today is people are withdrawing from those, because they reduce the ability to connect deeply. Two out of four of my kids have stopped using Facebook. </p>
<p>The Learning Revolution is an attempt to bridge the conversations on learning. I’m surprised at how we lost the ability to have those deep conversations.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> What is an unconference?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hargadon: </strong>An unconference is several dozen alternate meeting cafés. We put up posters around. People write topics, vote on the topics that are of interest to you.<br/>
If the popular ones conflict — you put all of those into a grid.</p>
<p>It’s conversations. Somebody says I want to talk about mobile devices and learning, or blogging for students. People go to the ones they want to go to, holding an hour of conversation. People who created the <a href="https://www.edcamp.org" target="_blank">Ed Camp</a> movement were going to <a href="http://www.edubloggercon.com" target="_blank">EduBloggerCon</a>.</p>
<p>People would gather in the morning and come up with ideas. That was the early EduBloggerCon [which has since become <a href="http://www.isteunplugged.com" target="_blank">ISTE Unplugged</a>]. It was a day of hacking — intellectual hacking.</p>
<p>We talked about agency and education. At the time, “agency” was not a word we used often when talking about education. </p>
