<p>An Illinois school system has upgraded its computer security  set-up for its three high schools. <a href="http://www.maine207.org/" target="_blank">Maine  Township High School District 207</a> in Park Ridge has put in place firewalls  from <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/" target="_blank">Palo Alto Networks</a> to  secure data coming onto the network from the Internet and <a href="http://www.arubanetworks.com/products/security/network-access-control/" target="_blank">Aruba  ClearPass Policy Manager</a> for overseeing device access to the wired and  wireless networks.</p>
<p>The deployment included placing a <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/next-generation-firewall/pa-3000-series" target="_blank">PA-3020</a> next-generation firewall at each campus with subscriptions for threat  prevention, URL filtering and the company's threat analysis cloud service. That  firewall offers 2 Gbps firewall throughput, 1 Gbps threat prevention throughput  and 500 Mbps VPN throughput. Aruba's software handles on-boarding and network  access of devices.</p>

<p>The school system runs a 1-to-1 program, and the district  segments its network to provide a private network for faculty and staff, a  separate secure network for students and a guest network. The upgrade on  security came at a time when the district was seeking to improve security  policy management, access control and oversight of the wireless network.</p>
<p>The use of technology from the two companies "has been  a great combination," said Jon Urbanski, district network manager, in a  statement. "Before, we could only control access based on IP or MAC  address, but because of the compatibility between Palo Alto Networks and Aruba,  now we can push policies to individual users and devices on both our wireless  and wired networks."</p>
