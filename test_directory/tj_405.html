<p>Several major companies in the toys and games industry have invested in a California-based startup that builds immersive games and content for its flagship iPad accessory.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/08/osmo-raises-24-million-from-sesame-mattel-and-other-big-names-in-toys-and-education/" target="_blank"><em>TechCrunch</em> reported</a> that <a href="https://www.playosmo.com/en/" target="_blank">Osmo</a>, “an early entrant in IoT toys,” has raised $24 million in funding from <a href="http://play.mattel.com/" target="_blank">Mattel</a>, <a href="http://www.sesameworkshop.org/" target="_blank">Sesame Workshop</a>, <a href="http://www.hmhco.com/" target="_blank">Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</a> and several venture capital funds. </p>
<p>Osmo’s gaming system, designed for children ages 5–12, utilizes its own Reflective Artificial Intelligence technology to integrate physical puzzle pieces, blocks and other toys into a digital environment. With <a href="https://www.playosmo.com/en/pizza-co/" style="text-decoration: none;">Pizza Co.</a>, for example, students learn business and math skills as they run their own virtual pizza shop using tangible money tiles that register on their iPad.</p>
