<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov" target="_blank">NASA</a> and <a href="https://www.ti.com" target="_blank">Texas Instruments</a> (TI) today launched “The Search for STEMnauts,” a virtual scavenger hunt designed to ignite students’ interest in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). </p>
<p>Each week for the next six weeks, students in sixth through 12th grade will be challenged to solve space-related puzzles for a chance to unlock virtual reward points. The student team with the most points at the end of the challenge will win a prize package that includes TI’s new, limited-edition Galaxy Gray graphing calculator, a $500 Amazon gift card, a NASA swag bag and a live video chat with an astronaut.</p>
<p>The weekly challenges will range in difficulty from beginner to advanced and introduce students to the coding and problem-solving skills NASA employees, including astronauts, use in their jobs every day. From cracking a code using TI’s basic programming language to calculating the travel time between Earth and Mars, students will put their STEM skills to the test.</p>

<p>“The future of space exploration lies in the hands of students in today's classrooms,” said Peggy Whitson, a NASA astronaut who has been to outer space three times and is currently living and working on the International Space Station, in a statement. “By creating opportunities to encourage teamwork, creativity and problem-solving, we can make learning fun and set students on a course to become the next generation of explorers.”</p>
<p>Students who accept the mission will automatically be entered to win TI’s new Galaxy Gray TI-84 Plus CE. Students will also be invited along on weekly virtual field trips, featuring exclusive, behind-the-scenes access to NASA’s headquarters. Student teams can check out where they stand in relation to their classmates and other competing teams from around the country by following real-time updates to the “Search for STEMnauts” leaderboard on the contest website, <a href="https://www.stemnauts.com" target="_blank">STEMnauts.com</a>.</p>
<p>“We've added a high-tech, interactive twist to the traditional scavenger hunt that will appeal to all students,” said Peter Balyta, president of Texas Instruments Education Technology, in a statement. “By making a game out of learning important skills, like coding and problem-solving, we hope to foster a life-long love of STEM and open students up to a variety of exciting career opportunities.”</p>
