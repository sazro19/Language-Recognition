<p>As education institutions <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/12/as-covid-cases-rise-colleges-scrap-plans-to-reopen-for-the-spring.html">aim
to become more flexible</a> to meet modern demands,
teachers will continue operating under hybrid learning models —
making the need for disruption-free virtual lessons and network
access all the more critical. To best accommodate these needs,
investing in a flexible IT infrastructure that can support
remote-learning, especially as our country undergoes one of the most
pivotal time periods in history, will be an important factor.</p>
<h3>Cost-Efficient Solutions to Tackle
Academic Resilience 
</h3>
<p>Due to declining enrollment rates and
increasing costs driven by COVID, schools are facing <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/how-colleges-are-adjusting-their-2021-2022-tuition">tight

Knowing this, IT departments should look toward cost-effective
solutions that will support their remote workforce and students. A
hybrid and multicloud environment, built on hyperconverged
infrastructure (HCI), is a proven model. It allows organizations to
benefit from lower costs and the increased security of private cloud,
for predictable workloads, while giving the flexibility to burst onto
public cloud resources as needed. This allows institutions to more
closely monitor IT infrastructure spending while gaining the
flexibility necessary to quickly adapt.</p>

<p>At the start of the pandemic, school
districts like <a href="https://upshotstories.com/stories/centralizing-infrastructure-to-democratize-education">Millard
Public Schools</a> in Nebraska were tasked with upgrading
their IT infrastructure, simplifying operations and strengthening
their business continuity plan to support distance learning for their
24,000 students. However, as a public school district, they needed to
act with financial probity. Investing in HCI allowed the district to
create a consistent and outstanding educational experience for
students while providing ways to maximize investment. For example,
instead of operating dedicated labs and buying hundreds of high-end
workstations for students learning CAD, they now run virtual desktops
on low-end laptops. Students can remotely access fully functional
high-powered graphics, with limited financial investment needed.</p>
<h3>Security Threats Remain and Must be
Identified 
</h3>
<p>In 2019 alone, <a href="https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/34822/the-state-of-ransomware-in-the-us-report-and-statistics-2019/">89</a>
U.S. universities, colleges and school districts were victims of
ransomware attacks, followed by at least 30 in the first five months
of 2020. With the increase in the possibility of both outside and
inside threats, schools and districts must be able to detect and
mitigate unusual behavior within their networks such as failed
authentications, unforeseen increases in network traffic, or large
volumes of file uploads. Technologies that provide role-based access
control, identity and access management, and multifactor
authentication to allow only authorized users into programs and
restrict them to certain activities will enable a stronger security
posture. A unified hybrid and multicloud environment will also
provide the necessary end-to-end visibility, and enable common
security policies.</p>
