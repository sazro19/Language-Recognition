<p><a href="http://privacygrade.org/apps/com.google.android.apps.maps.html" target="_blank">Google  Maps</a> gets an A. The free version of <a href="http://privacygrade.org/apps/com.rovio.angrybirds.html" target="_blank">Angry Birds</a> gets a C. And <a href="http://privacygrade.org/apps/com.sinyee.babybus.abc.html" target="_blank">My  ABCs by BabyBus</a> gets a D. The letters assigned to each of these Android  apps are grades, and while A is great, D means failure — in privacy, that is.</p>
<p>Those grades and a million others were assigned through a  scanning application that combines automated techniques with crowdsourcing to  capture the behavior of an app and measure the gap that exists between how  people expect the app to behave and how it actually behaves. For example, while  people expect apps such as Google Maps to use location data from the  smartphone, there's little reason for a game like Angry Birds or an educational  app such as My ABCs to read phone status and location and gain network access  other than to identify users for market and customer analysis and deliver  targeted advertising.</p>

<p>That's why a research team at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a> has  launched <a href="http://privacygrade.org/home" target="_blank">PrivacyGrade</a>, a Web site  that shares privacy summaries that highlight the most unexpected behaviors of  an app. The goal is to help smartphone users manage their privacy better and  with more thought.</p>
<p>"These apps access information about a user that can be  highly sensitive, such as location, contact lists and call logs, yet it often  is difficult for the average user to understand how that information is being  used or who it might be shared with," said Jason Hong, associate professor  in the <a href="http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a>,  and primary investigator for the project in the <a href="http://cmuchimps.org/" target="_blank">Computer  Human Interaction: Mobility Privacy Security (CHIMPS) Lab</a>. "Our  privacy model measures the gap between people's expectations of an app's  behavior and the app's actual behavior.</p>
<p>PrivacyGrade also examines which third-party code libraries  make use of the resources culled by the app. If the app accesses location data,  the program checks to see if it's used by a library such as Google Maps,  suggesting it is simply being used for mapping, or if it is being used by an  advertising library, an indication that it will be used for targeted ads.</p>
<p>The application doesn't currently include paid apps, since  the presumption is that because the developers receive income from sales,  they're less likely to sell user data to other companies. Eventually, the  CHIMPS team may add additional apps to the site, for iOS, Windows Mobile and  Blackberry, if funding permits.</p>
<p>The work was funded through a <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1228813&amp;HistoricalAwards=false" target="_blank">National  Science Foundation grant</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=29" target="_blank">Army Research Office</a>, <a href="http://www.nq.com/" target="_blank">NQ Mobile</a> and Google through its <a href="http://research.google.com/university/relations/research_awards.html" target="_blank">faculty  award program</a>.</p>
