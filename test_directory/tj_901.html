<p>Nearly every large organization has experienced some kind of  "significant" IT security incident in the last year, such as a  phishing attack, compliance policy violation or unsanctioned device or  application use. One in six have had five or more such events. Yet, only a  third of security professionals have any confidence that their operations will  be able to address inadequate security controls through investment or upgrade.  Four out of 10 security people find it more challenging to manage security  problems now vs. two years ago. The four biggest challenges among that group:  prevention, diagnosis, remediation and identification.</p>
<p>These are some of the findings of a research project done by <a href="http://www.idgconnect.com/" target="_blank">IDG Connect</a> for <a href="http://www.forescout.com/" target="_blank">ForeScout</a>, a company that sells security  products. The researchers queried 1,600 "IT information security decision  makers" in American and European organizations with more than 500  employees. Twenty four percent of the survey respondents were in the education  segment.</p>

<p>The report, "<a href="http://www.forescout.com/stateofdefense/" target="_blank">State of IT Cyber Defense  Maturity</a>," free with registration, stated that education (along with  manufacturing and finance) were "more prone" to phishing attack than  other segments.</p>
<p>In the areas of policy definition, technical controls and  mitigation capabilities, the education sector came out as the least mature.  Education also appears to have more issues with virtual machine security (68  percent) and inventory management (65 percent) compared to the industry  aggregate (58 percent and 58 percent, respectively).</p>
<p>The education sector was the least confident of any that it  would be able to address gaps in security event logging and monitoring tools.  Likewise, only a third of education respondents reported that they were  "very confident" they could improve security measures for managing  mobile devices anytime soon; the remainder were either not or only somewhat  confident they could address this area.</p>
