<p><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/" target="_blank">Panda Security</a> has updated its <a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/enterprise/solutions/cloud-systems-management/" target="_blank">Systems Management</a> platform to allow agents to be installed remotely from the Web management console. Once that's happened, the software will automatically detect other computers on the network that lack the agent and allow it to be added with a click. The latest release also can add targeted patches to policies for more granular control in patch management.</p>
<p>The update adds the ability for IT to define the characteristics of passwords set by users on their company iOS devices. Network administrators can also block specific functions on the phone or tablet, such as installing games or apps. Virtual private network and Wi-Fi settings of handsets can also now be configured from a central location.<br/>

<p>Systems Management is a cloud-based program that provides centralized oversight of all devices on the network. Agents are available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android and iOS, as well as via SNMP without an agent for printers and other network devices. The software provides remote locking and data wiping for mobile devices.</p>
<p>"The new features of Systems Management offer companies simpler management and increase user productivity", said Product Manager Director Manuel Santamaría. "All of this results in cost reduction, favoring independence of the IT administrator and providing the best security for the client's IT network."</p>
