<p>As districts upgrade or expand their wireless networking infrastructure to support 1-to-1, online assessments and other digital learning initiatives, many are future-proofing their investment by moving to 802.11ac technology, the latest WiFi specification.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.whitebear.k12.mn.us/" target="_blank"><strong>White Bear Lake Area Schools</strong></a></span> (MN) is one of those districts. According to director of technology <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.whitebear.k12.mn.us/Staff-Directory.asp?staff=123545" target="_blank">Mark Garrison</a></span>, the district had a total of about 200 access points and needed approximately 750 to support its new 1-to-1 initiative. Adding more than 500 new APs to the existing network would have cost as much as replacing the entire wireless infrastructure, so they went the replacement route with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.extremenetworks.com/" target="_blank">Extreme Networks</a></span>. They started implementing the new system last summer and planned to complete it in March. </p>

<p>Garrison said, "We could have kept with 802.11n, and that would have been fine, but we want this infrastructure to last five to eight years. We have to think about how much more data students will be pushing through there, and this certainly seemed like [the] way to go." Part of Garrison's planning was based on the lifecycle of today's mobile devices. "We need that infrastructure to last through three generations of [client] devices, so we try to think in terms of infrastructure that will be compatible with those devices. If schools can afford it, they should go with the up-and-coming standard because it's going to serve them better in the long run."</p>
<p><strong>Helping Older Devices Run Better<br/>
</strong>While 802.11ac-compatible laptops, tablets, smartphones and other devices are becoming more commonly available on the market, 802.11n devices are still prevalent in schools. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://qcsd.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Quakertown Community School District</strong></a></span> (PA) has had districtwide wireless infrastructure for six or seven years but recently replaced its entire wireless setup with 802.11ac technology from <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.arubanetworks.com/" target="_blank">Aruba Networks</a></span>. According to director of technology Joe Kuzo, the existing equipment was due to be refreshed, and, like White Bear Lake, Quakertown made the decision to make the jump to 802.11ac. Although a few of the newer laptops in the district office support the 802.11ac standard, Kuzo said, most devices in the district still use 802.11n — but even those devices have seen some benefit from the new network.</p>
<p>"I won't say it's drastic by any means," said Kuzo, "but in our high-concentration areas we get slightly better connections even on an 802.11n client. As we start transitioning equipment over to supported 802.11ac cards, that's when we're really going to see more noticeable change."</p>
<p>Erik Heinrich, the former director of IT for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.sfusd.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>San Francisco Unified School District</strong></a></span>, oversaw that district's 802.11ac implementation. Since then he has moved on to a new role as SLED (state and local government and education) engagement manager for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ruckuswireless.com/" target="_blank">Ruckus Wireless</a></span>. According to Heinrich, 802.11n devices may experience a performance boost when connected to 802.11ac infrastructure because the "newer access points that support the 802.11ac standard are built with newer engineering, and the faster processors improve the performance for older clients because it's processing the data more quickly," he said. "So even for the older 802.11n devices, they're seeing better range and performance, even if they're not leveraging 802.11ac protocol. It's just better hardware inside the access point."</p>
