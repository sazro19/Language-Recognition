<p><a href="http://iqonsite.com/" target="_blank">IQ Onsite</a>, a company that  provides mobile tools for constituent relationship management, has launched  Campus Ping, a communication tool for educational institutions, with two new  pilot programs.</p>
<p>Campus Ping "is a smart phone app that enables organizations  to send and receive proximity-based targeted messages and security alerts using  wireless iBeacon and GPS technologies," according to a news  release. Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to send alerts to or from students,  faculty or security in a specific part of campus;</li>
<li>A silent alarm;</li>
<li>The ability to send non-emergency  communications, such as announcements, requests, evaluations and information  about special events, entertainment and marketing; and</li>
<li>Tools for documenting incidents to the  organization's incident management platform for easy reporting and retrieval.</li>
</ul>
<p>Florida's <a href="http://myvolusiaschools.org/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Volusia County School  District</a> is currently piloting the app as a parent communication tool.</p>

<p>"We were impressed with the Campus Ping app as a way for  us to conveniently communicate directly with parents, and the project's zero  cost was instrumental in our decision to adopt the program," said Volusia  County School District spokeswoman Nancy Wait in a prepared statement. "We  are piloting the app with 10 schools within our district to work out any kinks  and make sure it functions the way we want it to before rolling it out in all  70 schools."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.daytonastate.edu/" target="_blank">Daytona State College</a> will launch the app in April for use by students and faculty.</p>
<p>"We look forward to seeing how Campus Ping works in the  trial run," said Tom LoBasso, president of Daytona State College, in a  prepared statement. "With the safety of our students and staff on campus a  top priority, we continually explore effective ways to increase safety  communication and alerts."</p>
<p>"In today's world it is more important than ever to give  students and parents a tool that allows them to engage with campus security and  administration in real-time, by adapting to the evolution of technology with  the main device virtually every citizen communicates with – their smartphone,"  said James Beckmann, founder and president of IQ Onsite, in a news release. "It's  simply logical to empower the millions of active bystanders within campus  communities to work hand-in-hand with authorities as partners to help keep our  schools and surrounding environments as safe as they can be."</p>
