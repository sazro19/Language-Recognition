<p>A free application management and reporting platform that helps district leaders evaluate the effectiveness of various education apps debuted its public beta version at the <a href="http://sxswedu.com/" target="_blank">SXSWedu conference</a> last week in Austin.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.getcatchon.com/" target="_blank">CatchOn</a> delivers real-time data on which apps are being used, how often and where to help keep track of technology investments, according to its website. It measures the financial impact of apps by analyzing district data, revealing the percentage of the budget per app and comparing it with the consumption across an entire district. According to a news release, the platform addresses the education app “sprawl” and helps districts and schools invest wisely, inform training, improve usage and spot trends.</p>
