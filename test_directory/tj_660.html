<p><a href="http://www.cps-k12.org/" target="_blank">Cincinnati Public Schools</a> (CPS) is launching a pair of week-long boot camps in an
effort to prepare students for the rigors of Advanced Placement (AP) courses ahead of an expansion of its blended AP programs.</p>
<p>CPS launched the blended learning AP program last school year in an effort to reach students with limited or non-existent access to AP
courses in their own schools. As part of the program, CPS provides mobile devices, digital curriculum and a high-speed Internet connection
through <a href="http://www.kajeet.net/" target="_blank">Kajeet Education Broadband</a>.</p>
<p>Owing to growing interest from students, "CPS will expand the program for the 2015-16 school year to five AP courses — including Human
Geography, Psychology, English Literature, Statistics and Environmental Science — for approximately 520 students taught by six teachers at 10
schools," according to a news release. "Bringing technology into the classroom in this manner allows the district to teach more students with
fewer instructors, as much of the coursework can be done online and collaboratively with peers."</p>

<p>AT the summer boot camps, to be held at <a href="https://www.miamioh.edu/">Miami University</a> and the <a href="http://www.uc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Cincinnati</a>, students will receive a laptop with a case and a
<a href="http://www.kajeet.com/4u/education/solutions/devices/mifi.html" target="_blank">Kajeet SmartSpot</a>, a filtered mobile hotspot, also
with a case. Students will be introduced to AP coursework, get a look into a school day at college and practice skills such as using Google
Apps, Blackboard, self advocacy, collaboration, time management and writing.</p>
<p>"At Cincinnati Public Schools, we encourage our students to think beyond graduation, and take steps toward identifying and transitioning
into meaningful careers," said Laura Mitchell, deputy superintendent and chief academic officer, in a prepared statement. "We wanted to expand
our AP offerings, so that more students have the opportunity to earn college credits early and experience more of the rigor they will face in
post-secondary studies."</p>
