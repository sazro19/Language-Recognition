<p><strong>Background</strong>: K–12 classrooms are experiencing a massive investment in computing technology. As we have reported in the <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2017/04/03/4-trends.aspx">blog post</a> before, 50 percent of America’s classrooms appear to be at 1-to-1 with 100 percent coming up over the next five years. </p>
<p>The eternal question: "Ahhh, and what are teachers supposed to do with all those computers?"</p>
<p>Liz Kolb’s <a href="https://www.iste.org/resources/product?id=3975">new book</a> "Learning First, Technology Second: The Educator’s Guide to Designing Authentic Lessons" is, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=IOHO">IOHO</a>, an excellent tool towards helping teachers answer that eternal — and vexing question. Before diving into our review, we (CN &amp; ES) feel that we need to be clear: We are prime Kolb supporters and we support the <a href="http://www.tripleeframework.com/">Triple E Framework</a> explored in her book. Now, let’s dive into the book!</p>

<p>Well, not so fast (smilely face goes here). Who is Liz Kolb and why did she write this book? Liz Kolb was a classroom teacher for 20 years. Currently, <a href="http://www.soe.umich.edu/people/profile/kolb_liz/">Kolb</a> is a clinical associate professor in the <a href="http://www.soe.umich.edu/" target="_blank">School of Education at the University of Michigan</a> where her primary instructional responsibilities are teaching pre-service and in-service teachers how to use technology in the classroom. So, not only has Kolb personally struggled with using technology in the classroom, she deals with hundreds of teachers who are struggling with using technology in their classrooms. Bottom line: with respect to using technology in the K–12 classroom, Kolb knows of what she speaks. </p>
<p>One more fun fact: In 2008, Kolb wrote "<a href="http://www.iste.org/images/excerpts/TOYTUL-excerpt.pdf" target="_blank">Toys to Tools: Connecting Student Cell Phones to Education</a>," and in 2011, Kolb wrote "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cell-Phones-Classroom-Practical-Educators/dp/1564842991/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1497735941&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=liz+kolb" target="_blank">Cell Phones in the Classroom: A Practical Guide for Educators</a>" — a now classic book in how to use cell phones in the classroom. Like we said: Kolb knows educational technology. <em>Now</em>, we are ready for the book review! </p>
<p>The title of the book: "Learning First, Technology Second" is really important. It is well known that schools tend to buy technology first and then try to figure out what to do with it. (Example: The failure of this strategy in Los Angeles has been <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/05/los-angeles-edtech/">well documented</a> in the media.) But regardless of the district’s technology strategy, Kolb’s book directs the <em>individual</em> classroom teacher to first identify her/his learning goals, and then to identify how technology can be used to further the learning. </p>
<p>Now, typically, the learning goal in the K–12 classroom has been "engagement" — use the technology to increase a student’s involvement with the learning activities. But, </p>
<ul>
<li>"…. In my 20 years of teaching, I have found that technology almost always engages students. However, over the last six years, I have come to understand that there are different types of engagement when it comes to technology tools. Authentic engagement is not about using a specific technology tool…"  (The above and following quotes are from Kolb’s new book.)</li>
