<p>Blackboard CEO Bill Ballhaus</p>
</div>
<p>When William (Bill) Ballhaus was named head of <a href="http://www.blackboard.com" target="_blank">Blackboard</a> in early January, ushering the end of Jay Bhatt's leadership at the education technology company, industry observers were quick to come out with their opinions on what the new chairman, CEO and president should do.</p>
<p>"Ballhaus inherits a company with a number of problems," <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/what-blackboards-new-ceo-needs-to-do-now-and-how-you-can-tell-if-hes-doing-it/" target="_blank">wrote consultant Michael Feldstein in his prompt commentary</a>. "Their customers are increasingly unhappy with the support they are getting on the current platform, unclear about how they will be affected by future development plans, and unconvinced that Blackboard will deliver a next-generation product in the near future that will be a compelling alternative to the competitors in the market." Among Feldstein's recommendations: prove to the market that Ultra is "real," lay out the future of 9.x and managed hosting and improve its support.</p>

<p>Joshua Kim at <em>Inside Higher Ed</em> was more succinct. He <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning/advice-blackboard%E2%80%99s-new-ceo" target="_blank">advised</a> Ballhaus to "bet the company on analytics."</p>
<p>Mark HuYoung, managing partner at NorthWind Partners, <a href="http://www.northwind-partners.com/william-ballhaus-named-chairman-president-and-ceo-of-blackboard-inc" target="_blank">considered the selection of Ballhaus "exciting."</a> As HuYoung noted, "He's in rarified air being relatively young and having already had two successful turns in [private equity]. Bill is in a position to swing at the pitches he wants and has chosen to swing at a Providence [Equity Partners] investment that requires some attention." Those two "turns," of course, were DynCorp and SRA, both of which he led to acquisition.</p>
<p>Recently, we had the opportunity to talk with Ballhaus by phone to better understand what his plans for Blackboard are, where he sees the opportunities and challenges, and what gets him out of bed in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>THE: A <em>Washington Business Journal</em> article reported that you planned to spend your early days talking and listening to company executives and employees about where to best put the company's resources. What are some messages you've heard so far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bill Ballhaus: </strong>As a starting point, the thing I see and I'm super excited about is the unique positioning of the company with respect to the breadth of the offerings that we have and the breadth of our capabilities, the flexibility by which we deliver those to our clients, and our market breadth, spanning K-12, higher and corporate and government education.</p>
<p>It's at the essence of our differentiation in the market — and I think it's at the essence of the opportunity in front of us, which is to maximize the impact that we have on our customers and on the education community.</p>
<p>Associated with that opportunity, my focus is to make sure that everything we do is centered on two things. The first is to maximize the customer experience and ensure that we're serving them and supporting them as evaluated through their lens. And the second is around our role in innovating and developing products and getting those products and the benefits of our technology into the hands of our customers and the end users.</p>
<p><strong><strong>THE</strong>: What about customers? Have you visited any schools yet? What are they telling you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ballhaus: </strong>I have had the chance to speak with a few customers, and both the feedback and their comments tend to range. What I'm seeing is that our clients are really looking to us to help partner with them, to support their mission and their endeavors and what they're trying to do and the impact that they're trying to have on students.</p>
