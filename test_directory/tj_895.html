<p><a href="http://net-ref.com/">NetRef</a> is a new Internet management tool designed to provide safety for kids at school and at home. NetRef was developed by a group of concerned parents who are also experienced technologists with a combined 40 years of experience designing end-to-end network security systems for large public- and private-sector organizations. </p>
<p>According to the company, the NetRef educational security system:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>safeguards all internet access points, offering umbrella protection across a school’s networks and on all imported devices;</li>
<li>operates with all Web browsers including Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox; and all app ecosystems including iOS, Android, Chrome and Windows;</li>
<li>integrates centralized IT networks to desktops, laptops and personal mobile devices; and</li>
<li>provides multi-tiered, oversight functionality across the school, in the classroom, and by student. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>NetRef includes a teacher’s panel to alerts them when students are off task. Teachers can then block students from unassigned Web browsing and app usage. The system delivers daily and monthly reports that detail how the Internet is being deployed at the student, classroom, grade and school level.</p>
