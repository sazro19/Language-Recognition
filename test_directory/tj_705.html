<p>The iPad buying frenzy may be over. The late 2013 introduction of the low-cost <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/devices/">Chromebook</a> has given school districts an affordable alternative that they're gravitating to with gusto. Official numbers from market research firm <a href="http://www.idc.com/">IDC</a> confirmed the news last December when the company announced that while Apple had shipped 702,000 <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPads</a> to educational buyers in the third quarter, Google partners had shipped 715,000 Chromebooks.</p>
<p>While some observers might refer to this changing of the guard as a "return of the laptop" or the "tailing off of the tablet," to those doing the buying, that’s not quite the case. Valerie Truesdale, chief of technology, personalization and engagement for North Carolina's <a href="http://www.cms.k12.nc.us/"><strong>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools</strong></a>, said of the HP device in use at her district, "It's the size of a tablet; it's portable [like a laptop], but this Chromebook is another animal in between.”</p>

<p>Vendors, too, are using different approaches to classifying the Google-inspired device that includes a built-in keyboard, stores most of its files online and runs applications directly from the Internet. <a href="http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/group/laptops">Acer</a> and <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/chromebook">Samsung</a> put Chromebooks into the "computer" menu on their website, and give tablets their own pages. <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/laptops.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd&amp;~ck=mn">Dell</a> and <a href="http://shopping1.hp.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/WW-USSMBPublicStore-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewStandardCatalog-Browse?CatalogCategoryID=ixsQ7EN50MkAAAFDQa00QpdT">HP</a> include laptops, tablets and Chromebooks all together; while <a href="http://www.lenovo.com/us/en/">Lenovo</a> includes various members of its Chromebooks on both the laptop and tablet pages.</p>
<p>No matter how the Chromebook is classified, it's definitely filling a gap that addresses specific educational needs.</p>
<p><strong>The Price Is Right</strong></p>
<p>Charlotte-Mecklenburg began the evaluation for its latest device purchase (for 32,000 middle schoolers) by pulling together a dozen educators to test drive laptops, iPads and Chromebooks from a myriad of companies. The choices were ranked, and Chromebooks won. The district's middle schools were already using Samsung Chromebooks that it has purchased two years earlier to address a need in its science and social studies classes for supplementary digital materials to augment dated textbooks. For that purpose, the IT department had put at least two — and sometimes four — carts of 30 devices into each school.</p>
<p>In the most recent buying round, teachers gravitated to HP-built Chromebooks for several reasons. First, they wanted to use Google Apps for Education, the free suite of online applications for word processing, spreadsheet work and presentations. Chromebooks are almost purpose-built for those programs. Second, North Carolina was initially a Smarter Balanced consortium member (it has since withdrawn), and computing specifications for the Smarter Balanced online assessment required a non-touch keyboard and the ability to lock down the browser, which the Chromebook handled masterfully. Third, it came down to price. "HP came in with a bid that is about $220 per device, which is significant," said Truesdale. "When you're trying to provision 32,000, price is key."</p>
<p>Now 33 schools have received enough Chromebooks for a 1-to-1 ratio. Another 14 schools were scheduled to get their devices by mid-March.</p>
<p><strong>A Practical, Durable Form Factor</strong></p>
<p>Before <a href="http://www.newcaneyisd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1"><strong>New Caney Independent School District</strong></a> (TX) chose a device to lease for its 1-to-1 program, director of technology Dustin Hardin asked high school students what mattered to them. "We met with each one of their leadership groups and I asked them, 'If we were to give you a device to improve your education, that would help the learning process, what features would you want to have?' " Unanimously, he said, they wanted to have a keyboard, which was "very surprising."</p>
