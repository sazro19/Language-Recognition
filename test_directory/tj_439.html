<p><a href="http://www.masteryconnect.com" target="_blank">MasteryConnect</a> has added an
evidence capture feature to the teacher app <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2016/07/28/masteryconnect-launches-mobile-assessment-app.aspx" target="_blank">it released in July</a>.</p>
<p>Teachers can now take
photographs of student work while they use the digital assessment platform as they
move around the classroom. The mobile evidence capture feature had been
in beta
release undergoing testing by 100 instructors around the country.</p>
<p>The MasteryConnect platform is designed to help
teachers identify a
student's level of understanding of core academic concepts, allowing
them to
then personalize instruction for each student and each classroom.
Teachers use
iPads to gather in-the-moment formative data and then use the data to
match
resources to individual student needs.</p>
<p>With the new feature, teachers can snap photos of
student work, add notes
and view a student's complete portfolio of work. The feature is
designed to be
especially effective in project-based learning environments and can be
used on
field trips, in performances and other nontraditional teaching
environments.</p>

<p>MasteryConnect's platform can give immediate
feedback, assessments, results
and data that can lead to quick revision of teaching strategies.</p>
<p>Evidence capture enhances those capabilities by
identifying student needs
in real time. It is the first step in the company's plan to give
teachers more
ways to deliver artifacts of student learning to parents, teachers,
administrators and students themselves.</p>
<p>"Having the ability to take photos of student work
supports everything we
do, from special education to parent-teacher conferences," said Kelly
D'Annolfo,
an eighth-grade language arts teacher. "We are finally able to provide
visible,
tangible evidence of student learning all in one place."</p>
