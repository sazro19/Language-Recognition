<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://www.iste.org/" target="_blank">ISTE (International Society for Technology in Education) conference</a> next week (June 25-28) in San Antonio, TX, <a href="https://www.lightspeed-tek.com/" target="_blank">Lightspeed Technologies</a> has revealed a new logo, corporate identity and brand new audio and video product line focused on improving classroom instruction and collaboration.</p>
<p>First, as part of the company’s rebranding strategy, all classroom tools now fall into three pillars: engage, activate and collaborate. </p>
<p>David Solomon, the executive vice president and general manager of Lightspeed, said in a news release that the corporate rebrand and product launch have been eight years in the making. “The most important thing we want people to understand is that we are a learning company. As our vision has evolved, we have engaged with the best practices in the area of instruction and are focused on what actually goes on in the classroom.”</p>
<p>Additionally, the newest product line, <a href="http://info.lightspeed-tek.com/activate-your-classroom-for-group-learnin?utm_campaign=ISTE%202017&amp;utm_source=PRP%20Article&amp;utm_medium=ISTE%20Press%20Release" target="_blank">Activate</a>, includes an instructional audio and video platform that emphasizes all three pillars, according to information from Lightspeed. The Activate system also has a charging and control center; portable pods that double as handheld microphones; and access to the <a href="http://info.lightspeed-tek.com/collaborate-through-activate" target="_blank">Activate app</a> (for iOS and Android). Teachers can use the system and app to capture classroom audio and video and upload the files to the cloud for storage — reviewing them later for coaching or professional development. </p>

<p>“This new line of products focuses on small-group instruction. A pod sits with each group so teachers can quietly listen, giving them direct insight into student conversations happening around the room. This allows them to activate student learning and make informed decisions about when to intervene and when to let students explore topics for themselves,” Solomon said. </p>
<p>Lightspeed Technologies will be exhibiting in booth 3226 at ISTE. <em>The Journal </em>will be exhibiting in booth 754 at ISTE 2017.</p>
