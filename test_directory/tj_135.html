<p><a href="https://www.kajeet.net" target="_blank">Kajeet</a> has launched its <a href="https://www.kajeet.net/homework-gap-grant" target="_blank">second-annual Homework Gap Grant program</a>, which provides mobile hotspots to schools to distribute to students who may not have internet access at home.</p>
<p>This year's program will award 15 schools either a SmartSpot kit or a SmartBus package.</p>
<p>The Kajeet SmartSpot kits come with 10 individual devices and include up to 10 months of Kajeet Complete LTE service (up to the last day of the school year) at 500 MB per day per device. According to Kajeet, 500 MB seems to be adequate for most students. According to the company, "Kajeet  will manage the data and device controls for customers."</p>

<p>Alternately schools can choose the Kajeet SmartBus device with up to 10 months of Kajeet Custom service with up to 5 GB of data per month, with unused data carrying over from month to month. SmartBus, as its name implies, provides connectivity to students on their way to and from school.</p>
