<p><a href="http://www.aerohive.com/" target="_blank">Aerohive Networks</a>, a mobility and cloud networking solutions company, this week rolled out a new unified network management system capable of managing thousands of devices.</p>
<p>The new <a href="http://www.aerohive.com/products/network-management/hivemanager-ng-onpremises.html" target="_blank">HiveManager NG Virtual Appliance</a> is an on-premises version of NG, Aerohive's public cloud solution, according to information from the company. The difference lies in the installation and administration features that are specific to each environment. “HiveManager NG Virtual Appliance manages Aerohive’s unique cooperative-control WiFi architecture, which distributes network intelligence among its self-organizing devices and, as a result, does not require centralized and expensive controllers. This significantly reduces the cost of the network management platform,” a company statement said.</p>
