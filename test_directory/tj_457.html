<p>One of the major IT solution providers in the education space is renaming itself. <a href="http://www.connection.com/" target="_blank">Connection</a>, formerly known as PC Connection, is moving all of its subsidiaries, including GovConnection, into the new brand.</p>
<p>The move, according to Connection, is designed to better reflect the approach the company takes to its business.</p>
<p>"Since 1982, our goals have been deeply rooted in providing customer-centric IT  solutions and services for small- to medium-sized businesses, enterprises, and  public sector markets," said Tim McGrath, CEO/President of Connection, in a prepared statement. "The role of technology has undoubtedly changed over the  years, but our commitment has not. In the age of the digital transformation, we  have shifted from selling technology to connecting people with the resources  they need to build stronger, more efficient businesses. By removing the 'PC'  from our brand name, we are focusing on the next four decades and planning how  we will help customers connect with new and exciting ideas — whether those  innovations fit on a desk, in a data center, or inside tomorrow's wearable  technology. Our new brand name, Connection, better reflects the promise of our  future and the successes of our past." </p>
