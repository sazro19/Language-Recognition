<p> Google is adding new features that allow multiple students to share a single Android-based education tablet.</p>
<p>Tablets that support Google Play for Education will now be able to support up to five user accounts, according to Emily Bernier, a software engineer for Google Play for Education. Setup will remain essentially the same, with the added option of setting up one to five individual user accounts. Students are then given a PIN code to access their own accounts and their individual content.</p>
<p>Individual student accounts can also later be transferred to  new devices. For example, if students have previously had to share a device are given their own  devices on a 1-to-1 basis, their individual accounts — including apps and documents — can be transferred from the shared device to the new device.</p>
<p>Google Play for Education is a suite of software tools that include apps, reading materials, educational videos, digital content management, classroom content distribution and app management.</p>
<p>Devices  that support Google Play for Education are manufactured by ASUS, HP, Samsung and Google itself.</p>
