<p>Two networking companies have teamed up to improve wireless security coverage for their respective customers.
<a href="https://www.barracuda.com/" target="_blank">Barracuda Networks</a> and <a href="http://www.aerohive.com/" target="_blank">Aerohive
Networks</a> are working together to integrate Aerohive's HiveOS devices with Barracuda's security products.</p>
<p>Aerohive devices, including access points, switches and routers, will work more seamlessly with
<a href="https://www.barracuda.com/products/websecurityflex" target="_blank">Barracuda Web Security Service</a>,
<a href="https://www.barracuda.com/products/webfilter" target="_blank">Web Filter</a> and
<a href="https://www.barracuda.com/products/ngfirewall" target="_blank">NG Firewall</a>. As a result, customers running bring-your-own-device
environments are expected to gain better visibility into user identity, device type and IP address without the need for getting programs or
profiles installed on the client devices.</p>
<p>"We are excited about the Barracuda/Aerohive technology integration and the potential to provide our joint customers with leading
technologies to help them better manage their security initiatives," said Charles Kanavel, CEO of <a href="http://www.kanavelgroup.com/" target="_blank">The Kanavel Group</a>, which delivers IT professional and managed services to organizations and resells products from both
companies.</p>

<p>"We see the potential for the combined solution to simplify the complex IT environment without sacrificing any of the enterprise wireless
and security capabilities our customers need," added Rahul Narsimhan, founder and CEO of network and security integrator
<a href="http://www.securicore.ca/" target="_blank">Securicore</a>. "We have always felt an integration between the two would be a huge win for
our customers."</p>
