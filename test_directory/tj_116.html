<p class="deck" id="ph_pcontent3_3_Deck">A new report finds fewer than 10 percent of school districts report that all students have access to non-shared devices at home, while the number of schools offering broadband at school continues to rise.</p>

<p>Schools reporting that all their students have  access to the internet at home to complete homework through a non-shared device has remained constant at 10  percent or less since 2015, which puts a large number of students at a  disadvantage, according to <a href="http://www.cosn.org/Infrastructure">a new report</a> from <a href="http://www.cosn.org/">CoSN</a> and <a href="https://www.aasa.org/home/">AASSA, The School  Superintendents Association</a>.   This report is CoSN's annual survey of U.S. K-12 district connectivity; 386  school districts provided responses to 59 questions about school infrastructure  this year.</p>
<p>Fifty-four percent of school districts report that more than  three-quarters of their students have access to shared devices at home, and 47  percent of districts estimate more than 75 percent of students have access to  libraries and community centers that have non-shared devices. </p>
<p>"Students need access to devices and robust internet  connectivity in school and at home," the report finds.  "Students lack 1-to-1 device access at home  have more limited learning opportunities and may have difficulty completing  their homework. That difficulty puts them at a disadvantage compared to their  better-resourced peers."</p>

<p>When It comes to broadband in schools, 69 percent of school  districts report that they are "very confident" in their network's ability to  support one or more devices per student as compared to 58 percent in the prior  year.  Ninety-two percent of school  districts report that they are meeting the Federal Communications Commission's  short-term goal of 100 Mbps per 1,000 students at their schools, and 35 percent  of school districts' report meeting the FCC's long-term goal of 1 GBPs per  1,000 students for all schools.</p>

<p>"Districts need robust, affordable broadband access to  enable digital teaching and learning," the report finds.  While there are several factors driving  broadband demand, the number of student devices continues to be the top driver  for three consecutive years."</p>
<p>Other findings in the CoSN report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forty percent of respondents report having more  broadband bandwidth than they currently use. Three-quarters of districts report  paying less than $5 per Mbps for their internet as compared to 60 percent in  the prior year.</li>
<li>Over the next three years, device to student  ratios are expected to improve dramatically.   The rate of one device per two students is expected to drop from 21  percent to three percent and 38 percent of students are projected to have two  devices at their disposal.</li>
<li>When it comes to purchasing decisions, half of  districts cite in interoperability as a major consideration.  Forty-nine percent of respondents cited  budget constraints as extremely challenging and 46 percent rated the lack of  common technical standards as very challenging or extremely challenging.</li>
<li>Eighty-eight percent of districts are using  cloud-based software systems.  Learning  management systems are most likely to be in the cloud with only 11 percent of  districts reporting that they plan to continue to host manually. For those  districts not in the cloud, 32 percent of respondents cite cost as the main  barrier to entry.</li>
<li>Thirty-six percent of districts are allocating  10 percent or more of their technology budgets to network security. Forty-seven  percent of respondents report phishing is the most common concern for districts,  followed by ransomware at 23 percent.</li>
