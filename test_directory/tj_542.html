<p><a href="http://www.southsanisd.net/" target="_blank">South San Antonio Independent School District</a> (SSAISD) has upgraded to a private, fiber-optic broadband network to
support data, video and voice services at the district's 16 schools and
administrative facilities.</p>
<p>The district is aggressively ramping
up its digital learning platforms and needed a faster and more scalable
network to support those initiatives, said Ramiro Zuniga, director of
technology for SSAISD, in a news release. The district selected a new
fiber-optic network from <a href="http://www.conterra.com/" target="_blank">Conterra Broadband Services</a>.
The multi-gigabit network serves nearly 10,000 students and more than
1,350 staff members, and Conterra monitors, manages and supports the
network around the clock, every day. In the future, the district will
be able to scale up the network to 100 gigabits per location without
any additional construction.</p>
<p>"The network must work and provide
the speed and scalability to support all our digital initiatives of the
district," said Zuniga. "The demands on our infrastructure will grow
exponentially, and we are now prepared to meet those demands head-on
for a very long time."</p>
