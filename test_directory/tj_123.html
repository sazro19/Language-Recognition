<p>VMware this week rolled out the newest versions of its virtual platforms <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html" target="_blank">VMware Workstation 15</a> and <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/2018/09/vmware-fusion-11-is-here.html" target="_blank">VMware Fusion 11</a>, which include enhanced UIs, expanded OS and hardware support, a refined remote VMware vSphere view and new REST APIs.</p>
<p>According to the company, the new REST API for Workstation Pro will "enable developers to remotely and programmatically manage virtual machines (VM) running" on the platform, as well as "integrate with other automation tools in a continuous development and testing pipeline." Custom in-house desktop request workflows can also be built by developers and QA teams, which will allow for automated Workstation VM deployment, the company claims.</p>
<p>Support for Ubuntu 18.04.1, Windows October 2018 Updates and others is now available in both Workstation 15 Pro and Workstation 15 Player, plus an enhanced UI experience on 4K and HiDPI displays. In addition, the company reported there are now more than 500 new feature icons and updated product icons, and both solutions support a new DirectX 10.1 virtual graphics engine with Anti-Aliasing and Shader support.</p>

<p>With Workstation 15 Pro's improved remote vSphere view, IT admins will be able to access a more accurate description of the host topology, and when connected to a remote vSphere environment, all clusters and datacenters  —  in addition to an inventory of all VMs  —  can be seen, according to the company.</p>
<p>Fusion 11 Pro's REST API, which already allows developers to integrate with Docker, Vagrant, Kubernetes and other development tools, has been improved so "developers can leverage new networking-oriented controls to programmatically assign and change virtual networks, organize MAC to IP Address binding and specify NAT port forwarding rules on the fly," according to VMware. </p>
<p>
Among other new features in the Fusion 11 solutions are: 


<ul>
<li>A new Application Menu, which can run with or without Fusion 11, and gives users the ability to access VM inventory; change view modes, settings and snapshots; or launch Windows applications with a single click.</li>
<li>Expanded hardware and OS support, including support for the new 18-core iMac Pro and macOS 10.14 Mojave.</li>
<li>Several UI improvements including a customizable touch bar for MacBook users, updated icons and DirectX 10.1 graphics support.</li></ul>
<p>Like Workstation 15 Pro, Fusion 11 Pro also includes the improved remote vSphere view, providing a more complete description of the host topology.</p>
<p>"The latest enhancements to Workstation 15 and Fusion 11, including delivering REST APIs to automate tasks, provide IT pros, developers and businesses alike with a seamless way to deliver, better protect and manage Windows, Linux and Mac desktops and applications on premises or in the cloud," said Krish Prasad, senior vice president and general manager of VMware's Cloud Platform Business Unit, in a prepared statement.</p>
