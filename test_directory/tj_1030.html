<p>According to a new report from <a href="http://www.idc.com/" target="_blank">International Data Corp.</a>, an increase in mobility applications and the continued emergence of 802.11ac have made the enterprise WLAN market one of the fastest growing networking market segments worldwide.</p>
<p>According to preliminary results published in IDC's <a href="http://www.idc.com/tracker/showproductinfo.jsp?prod_id=262" target="_blank">Worldwide Quarterly WLAN Tracker</a>, the combined consumer and enterprise worldwide WLAN market segments increased 11.5 percent year over year in the fourth quarter of 2013, while the enterprise segment increased 11.7 percent over the same period. For the full year 2013, the enterprise WLAN market jumped 15 percent compared to the previous year, and the consumer WLAN market increased 11 percent. According to IDC, growth in the consumer WLAN space appears to be accelerating due to strong growth in the emerging markets and market transition from the older 802.11n standard to the newer and faster 802.11ac standard.</p>
<p>"Across all geographies and in most of the key verticals, the expansion of mobility applications for enterprise IT continues to drive new investments in WLAN infrastructure," said Rohit Mehra, vice president for network infrastructure at IDC, in a prepared statement. "While the growth rate has stabilized in recent quarters, new mobility applications, particularly for the education, retail and healthcare verticals, along with expanded deployment options and the continued emergence of 802.11ac will lead to continued growth in the enterprise WLAN market."</p>
