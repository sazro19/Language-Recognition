<p>The stakes for broadband capacity that schools and districts  across America have come to rely on for ensuring they can deliver a robust  digital education are being raised. Today, the <a href="http://www.setda.org/" target="_blank">State  Educational Technology Directors Association</a> (SETDA) released a report  featuring new goals for internet and wide area network (WAN) services.</p>
<p>But unlike SETDA's 2012 recommendations, which have been  picked up and promulgated by the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/connected_fact_sheet.pdf" target="_blank">White  House</a>, the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/" target="_blank">United States Department of  Education</a> and the <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-13-100A1.pdf" target="_blank">Federal  Communications Commission</a>, among others, this latest round of goals in "<a href="http://www.setda.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SETDA-Broadband-ImperativeII-Full-Document-Sept-8-2016.pdf" target="_blank">The  Broadband Imperative II: Equitable Access for Learning</a>" offers nuances  that were missing the first time around.</p>

<p>For example, the earlier recommendations offered a single  set of goals for all schools. This year's set breaks that up by size of  district: small (fewer than 1,000 students); medium (about 3,000 students); and  large (more than 10,000 students). The medium-sized district goal in the latest  report is the only one whose targets for the 2017-2018 school year mesh with  the recommendation offered four years ago.</p>

<p>This year's recommendations vary by size of  district.</p>

<p>"This  is a much needed clarification," said Susie Strangfield, CIO for <a href="http://www.ode.state.or.us/home/" target="_blank">Oregon's Department of Education</a>. "Establishing  a floor for districts allows solutions to be scaled appropriately to meet local  needs. One size doesn't necessarily fit all. In Oregon, this will allow  districts to appropriately plan for and meet the new SETDA broadband  recommendations."</p>
<p>The newest set of SETDA recommendations also provides internet  capacity targets for 2020-2021, which are approximately three times that of the  2017-2018 aims.</p>
<p>All of these targets, the report stated, "are based on  research; analysis of data sets from districts across eight states regarding  both capacity and usage; and consultation with experts in the field." In  point of fact, besides primary authors Christine Fox from SETDA and Rachel  Jones, an educational consultant, the report references 33 additional  contributors from state departments of education, education organizations and  industry.</p>
<p>"Today's students need robust bandwidth access to help  ensure that their learning experiences are effectively preparing them for  college and future careers," said Tracy Weeks, executive director of  SETDA, in a prepared statement. "Broadband access supports trends that  shift away from traditional learning models towards digital learning  opportunities that include dynamic digital instructional materials, online  simulations, coding and content creation."</p>
<p>On the WAN front, next year's goal matches exactly what was  put forth in 2012: at least 10 Gbps per 1,000 users. And that measure stays in  place at least through 2020-2021.</p>
