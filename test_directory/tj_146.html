<p>In our technology-driven world, any  conversation about data invariably leads to questions about how that information  is protected and used. That curiosity extends into school systems, which strive  to create robust, engaging, personalized learning environments while ensuring  that they implement mature governance practices to protect the privacy and  security of student data — information stored in the classroom and by district  technology providers on behalf of their school system clients.  </p>
<p>In particular, school systems need to  stay current with federal and state privacy laws, meet the expectations of  their parents and other community stakeholders, build partnerships with a  variety of vendors and manage complex networks capable of supporting hundreds  of student devices. In addition, school systems need to translate that work  into clear and comprehensible guidance to inform parents about school policies  for technology and how student data are protected.</p>

<p>It's no wonder that school systems are increasingly  seeking out trusted guidance to create and improve their governance programs  and build trust within the communities that they serve. A community of trust encourages  a healthy conversation between school systems and community members that moves  from fear-based to fact-based about the school practices and educational  progress of students.  </p>
<p>CoSN's (the Consortium  for School Networking's) Trusted Learning Environment (TLE) Seal Program was  specifically designed to support these needs. Developed with 28 school system  leaders, along with lead partners — the Association of School Business  Officials (ASBO), the School Superintendents Association (AASA) and ASCD — the TLE  Program helps school systems assess their privacy and security programs, identify  the specific areas that require improvement and provide resources to support  that work. </p>
<p>To date, 13 U.S. school systems — from  small, large, urban and rural communities — have already earned the TLE Seal by  carrying out robust data protection programs across the entire school  organization, including leadership, business relationships with technology  providers, data security and education for employees and community members, as  well as for students in the classroom. In taking the tangible, measurable steps  that help to ensure the privacy and security of student data, these Seal  recipients demonstrate their commitment to student data privacy in a way that builds  trust. </p>
<p>And the momentum is building. Today,  school systems — from Montana to Connecticut to Ohio to Texas — are coming  together to crowdsource their efforts and support each other statewide in  building and improving their governance programs.  </p>
<p>CoSN is supporting these cohorts by  connecting each group with a TLE Seal Recipient to serve as a mentor, providing  access to an online peer community dedicated to questions about data privacy, as  well as providing free guidance on implementation of the laws, vetting  technologies, writing contracts, understanding privacy policies and more. The  cohort leaders are able to share with districts in need how to leverage the TLE  framework and improve their efforts so they, too, can become leaders of  tomorrow. </p>
<p>This 21st-century challenge  for school systems has presented them with an opportunity to unite to build  stronger practices, stronger connections and embark on a journey of continuous  improvement for all. Together they are making a difference in the rigor with  which they are protecting student data — and the trust they are building within  their communities.  </p>
