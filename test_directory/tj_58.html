<p>An Oklahoma school system was the victim of a malware attack. According to <a href="https://www.newson6.com/story/41413229/bixby-school-district-investigating-malware-attack-at-middle-school">local reporting</a>, between 75 and 100 computers at <a href="https://www.bixbyps.org/">Bixby Public Schools</a> were brought down, primarily in the middle school and an athletic complex.</p>
<p>The school system found out about the break-in when a company in Florida notified Bixby that an IP address in the district was behind a hack of its network.</p>
<p>Superintendent Rob Miller told reporters that the IT department pulled the network down before too many computers had been compromised. The biggest loss, according to Miller, would be felt by Bixby Middle School teachers whose computers had to be replaced and who may have lost files not backed up. </p>
<p>"The good news," he told KOTV, "is that almost all of our district services are housed in the cloud, and we don't believe any student or employee personal data has been compromised."</p>
<p>Local police are helping with the investigation.</p>
