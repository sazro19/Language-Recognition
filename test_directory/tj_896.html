<p><a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a> has a new  sibling. The <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT Media Lab</a>-developed  programming environment intended for children recently welcomed <a href="http://www.scratchjr.org/" target="_blank">ScratchJr</a> into the world of kids' coding  tools. The new release is actually a free <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scratchjr/id895485086?mt=8" target="_blank">iPad app</a> intended to help children ages five to seven learn to program interactive  stories and games. Along the way, say the developers, these youngest students  will also learn how to create with a computer, not just interact with it.</p>
<p>Young users snap together graphical programming blocks to  make characters "move, jump, dance, and sing," says the App Store  description. They can modify their characters in a paint editor, add their own  voices and sounds and insert pictures of themselves. In the process, says the  development team, students learn concepts about problem solving, design,  creative expression and the use of math and language.</p>

<p>ScratchJr is a collaborative effort involving the <a href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Lifelong Kindergarten</a> research group at  the Media Lab, the <a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/devtech/" target="_blank">Developmental  Technologies Research Group</a> at <a href="http://www.tufts.edu/" target="_blank">Tufts  University</a>, and the <a href="http://www.playfulinvention.com/" target="_blank">Playful  Invention Company</a> (PICO).</p>
<p>"Coding is the new literacy," declared Mitchel Resnick,  head of the Lifelong Kindergarten.  "Just as writing helps you organize your thinking and express your ideas,  the same is true for coding. In the past, coding was seen as too difficult for  most people. But we think coding should be for everyone, just like  writing."</p>
<p>When young children code with ScratchJr, added DevTech  Director Marina Umaschi Bers, "they develop design and problem-solving  skills that are foundational for later academic success." By using math  and language in "a meaningful context," she said, "they develop  early-childhood numeracy and literacy."</p>
<p>Next steps for the app include taking it to other device  platforms, adding new features for sharing projects and creating curriculum and  support materials for teachers and parents.</p>
<p>The project was funded by the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/" target="_blank">National  Science Foundation</a>, <a href="http://codetolearn.org/" target="_blank">Code-to-Learn  Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.legofoundation.com/" target="_blank">Lego Foundation</a>,  and UK's <a href="http://www.insight.bt.com/en/hot-topics/scratch-jr" target="_blank">BT</a>.  Those next development steps will be funded through <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2023634798/scratchjr-coding-for-young-kids" target="_blank">a  successful Kickstarter campaign</a> that took two days to surpass its $25,000  goal.</p>
