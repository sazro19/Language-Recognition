<p>Through the end of the 2014-2015 school year, TabPilot Learning Systems is offering its <a href="http://www.tabpilot.com/beta">Tablet Manager for iOS</a> for free to all public and private K-12 schools with 25 or more iPads. This expansion of TabPilot’s “Early Experience” beta program allows schools to use Tablet Manager for free in exchange for feedback on the system. Final pricing is expected to be in the range of $5 to $10 per device per year, with an initial license purchase of the same amount.</p>
<p>TabPilot Tablet Manager is a combination mobile device management (MDM( and classroom management system for Android and iOS. Designed specifically for education, it can be managed entirely through a cloud-based interface.</p>
<p>MDM features include integration with Apple’s Device Enrollment Program, app distribution through Apple’s Volume Purchase Program, device security and inventory management. Classroom management features include the ability for teachers to freeze student screens or lock students into a single app or website. According to the company, features will be expanded as it gets feedback from users.</p>
