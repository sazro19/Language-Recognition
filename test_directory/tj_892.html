<p>Mobile devices give students instant access to interactive  online learning resources, but they also create classroom management challenges  for teachers, who can struggle to keep students engaged in the task at hand.  Many districts with BYOD or 1-to-1 initiatives have implemented enterprise  mobile device management (MDM) tools, such as those from <a href="http://www.air-watch.com/">AirWatch</a>, <a href="http://www.endpointprotector.com/">CoSoSys</a>, <a href="http://www.maas360.com/">MaaS360</a>, <a href="http://www.lightspeedsystems.com/">Lightspeed Systems</a> and <a href="https://www.soti.net/mobicontrol/">MobiControl</a>. IT departments  typically employ these products across a district or school and use them to  enforce security policies, track and locate devices, and monitor and manage  mobile apps. While the IT department is usually in control of enterprise MDM,  some tools also give teachers the ability to monitor students' online  activities, restrict access to specific online resources and even reset device  pass codes. We interviewed tech leaders at three districts to find out how they  are moving MDM into the classroom.</p>

<p><strong>Helping Teachers  Focus on Teaching<br/>
</strong><a href="http://www.cchs.us/">Calvary Christian High School</a> in Clearwater,  FL, became a BYOD school in the 2011-2012 school year. Students were required  to bring their own laptops. The school didn't have the resources to provide any  technical support for the devices, and teachers had to do their best to manage  devices in the classroom. Jeffrey Hutto, technical implementation coordinator  for the school, said, "This is our third year, and we've realized that the  amount of time and energy required for our teachers to manage that process is  excessive." According to Hutto, students were spending class time checking  their scores on ESPN, playing games and shopping online. "It was getting  to a completely ridiculous level," he said, "so we needed to stifle  that as much as we could."<strong></strong></p>
<p>The school considered restricting Internet access at the  network level, but Hutto said, "Anytime you create more security on the  network side, you start blocking access to good things that we actually need  our students to access." The school decided to implement a classroom  management tool that would give teachers control over the laptops. After an  extensive evaluation process, Hutto selected <a href="http://www.netsupportschool.com/">NetSupport School</a> because it  supported test proctoring, so teachers could lock down student devices when  administering online tests. NetSupport School also supports iPads, which the  school plans to implement in the coming years — not to mention that its  per-device pricing model was more economical for the school than the  per-classroom or per-teacher licenses offered by competitors. NetSupport School  will also enable Hutto to provide remote technical support and deploy  applications to student devices.</p>
<p>The school is just starting the process of implementing  NetSupport School and plans to have it in place for the beginning of the  upcoming school year, but the response to the plan has been overwhelmingly  positive. "I literally had one teacher jumping up and down with his hands  over his head like we had won the Super Bowl," said Hutto. "The  teachers are very encouraged about what this is going to do for them. They're  looking forward to not having to worry about some of these classroom details,  so they can just focus on teaching."</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring a Variety  of Devices<br/>
</strong><a href="http://www.bcs1.org/">Brockport Central School District</a> (NY)  supports almost 2,800 student devices, including more than 1,350 classroom PCs,  500 Dell tablets, 390 iPads, 375 netbooks and laptops on carts, another 200  laptops and 80 iPod Touches. Like their counterparts at Calvary Christian High  School, teachers at Brockport Central were having trouble managing students'  online activities in the classroom. About eight years ago, the district started  using a classroom management tool called <a href="http://www.netop.com/classroom-management-software/products/netop-school.htm">Netop  School</a>, which was succeeded by <a href="http://www.netop.com/classroom-management-software/products/netop-vision-pro.htm">Netop  Vision Pro</a> a couple of years ago. The new version manages tablets as well  as computers. Wayne Rickman, technical administrator for the district, said, "When  they came out with Vision Pro, they simplified it and made it easier for  teachers to use. It was more icon-based, and now they can access almost  everything from one main window."<strong></strong></p>
