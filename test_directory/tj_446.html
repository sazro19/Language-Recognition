<p><a href="http://www.lifeliqe.com" target="_blank">Lifeliqe</a>, a visual learning platform incorporating virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and interactive 3D content, is today launching Lifeliqe VR Museum, its first fully VR experience.</p>
<p>The free version will be available exclusively on <a href="http://www.viveport.com" target="_blank">Viveport</a>, HTC Vive’s content platform, with the premium version coming soon. HTC Vive is the third platform Lifeliqe is launching on after iOS and Windows 10.</p>
<p>Lifeliqe VR Museum is built on more than 1,000 interactive 3D models that are already available in Lifeliqe’s mobile version. Users can get engaged in two ways: VR can take them to a virtual world, where they can roam freely among dinosaurs or visit ancient housing; and the Explore function enables users to study interactive 3D models from K–12 sciences in a virtual lab, allowing them to learn about different parts in great detail.</p>

<p>“VR experience offers [a] completely different level of immersion and engagement and that is why it’s perfect for use in education,” said Ondrej Homola, co-founder and CEO of Lifeliqe, in a statement. “At the same time, teachers are now able to forge a connection with students, as they can use content that’s corresponding with what students are used to. And we’re all about creating that connection, since it leads to sparking light bulb moments and lifelong learning passion.”</p>
<p>In the free version of Lifeliqe VR Museum, users can enjoy two VR experiences and explore 12 interactive models. Later on, the premium version will offer more than 20 VR experiences and more than 1,000 interactive 3D models, tested by professors from universities around the world.</p>
<p>Lifeliqe has posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EN11pg4D10&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">video</a> of children trying out the pilot version of its VR Museum, as well as some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqLrdSuqOr0&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">product footage</a>.
