<p>In an effort to fill vacant teaching positions, <a href="http://www.bcsdk12.net/" target="_blank">Bibb County School District</a> (BCSD) in Georgia is expanding a pilot program that has “virtual teachers” instructing middle school and elementary school students.  </p>
<p>At the beginning of the 2016-17 school year, BCSD launched a pilot program at three schools – <a href="http://www.bcsdk12.net/Domain/3361" target="_blank">Weaver Middle School</a>, <a href="http://www.bcsdk12.net/Domain/472" target="_blank">Ballard-Hudson Middle School</a> and <a href="http://www.bcsdk12.net/Domain/1081" target="_blank">Martin Luther King Elementary</a> – where teachers would be live-streamed into classrooms. On Nov. 17, the school board approved the hiring of seven new virtual teachers and one substitute teacher at its meeting. </p>
<p>BCSD worked with <a href="https://www.proxlearn.com/" target="_blank">Proximity Learning</a>, a fully accredited online education provider based in Austin, TX, to find the virtual teachers. According to <a href="https://simbli.eboardsolutions.com/meetings/TempFolder/Meetings/IS-3%20Proximity%20Learning%20Inc.%20Contract%20_743832eerkyp0fc0in33exwwbbo2s2.pdf" target="_blank">an action memorandum</a>, the district in August hired three teachers for $144,000 to live stream into vacant classrooms. The cost of $48,000 per teacher is approximately $17,000 less than the cost of a live teacher. BCSD paid an additional $336,000 to hire seven new teachers, and $12,600 for a substitute teacher to supervise students and facilitate each class in-person. </p>
