<p><a href="http://www.sfps.info/" target="_blank">Santa Fe Public Schools</a> (SFPS) has
expanded its deployment of a fiber-based LAN to seven additional schools.</p>
<p>Following a successful implementation of the <a href="http://www.tellabs.com/optical-lan/" target="_blank">Optical LAN</a> solution from
Tellabs at <a href="http://www.sfps.info/index.aspx?nid=1242" target="_blank">Ramirez Thomas Elementary School</a> during the 2013-2014 school year,
the district has expanded its implementation to seven more schools this school
year. The fiber-based optical LAN "converges voice/VoIP, data, video, Wi-Fi,
security and other services onto a single fiber and centralizes all network
management functions," according to information from Tellabs. Students and
teachers at the schools use the high-speed network to access digital learning
technologies and online resources. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.itconnectinc.com/" target="_blank">IT Connect</a>, an information
technology systems integration company, implemented the Tellabs Optical LAN
solution at SFPS. According to a news release from Tellabs, deploying the
fiber-based network rather than upgrading its copper-based infrastructure saved
the district $60,000 in one school alone and eliminated the need for seven
communication closets. The district invested the savings in a new classroom.</p>

<p>"With Tellabs Optical LAN, we built a network infrastructure that has it all
— it's simple, flexible, sustainable and cost effective," said Elias
Bernardino, executive director of the SFPS technology department, in a prepared
statement. "Tellabs Optical LAN enabled us to leverage existing IT resources and
reduce costs, and then apply those savings to investments in other areas of
education."</p>
<p>Santa Fe Public Schools is located in Santa Fe, NM, and serves approximately
14,000 K-12 students at 35 schools. </p>
<p>SFPS and Tellabs will be at at <a href="http://www.fetc.org" target="_blank">FETC</a>, an
educational technology conference and tradeshow in Orlando, for a session called "Improve Digital Learning Environments by Going Against the
Mainstream" on Friday, January 23 at 2:00 p.m.</p>
