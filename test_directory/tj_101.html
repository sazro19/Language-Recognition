<p>When it comes to
using blockchain technology, there are several use cases across all
sectors that institutions are interested in.  However, some considerations need to be taken into account before jumping into
the technology in full force.  New America’s Blockchain Trust
Accelerator has released a checklist for deploying a
blockchain-powered solution in the blockchain sector:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Define your
    challenge, define your solution. Before adopting a blockchain-based
    solution, know your goal and how blockchain technology will help to
    achieve it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prep your data
    to ensure data to ensure that it is accurate and high quality before
    moving to the blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborate
    with partners in order to lower costs, improve outcomes and deliver
    more powerful solutions for everyone.  Identify potential
    stakeholders and consider inviting them to the party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think ahead in
    terms during the design process to address both legacy systems and
    other frontier technologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Innovate
    ethically because privacy is your responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider
    accessibility to ensure marginalized populations still have access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solve for
    identity to determine how user identity, biometrics, passwords,
    government issued IDs and knowledge-based authentication should or
    could be a part of your solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assess risks by
    anticipating potential pain points between collaborators and
    carefully weigh the pros and cons of design features like vendor and
    platform lock-in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expect to grow
    and think about how your ultimate goal is to reach full-scale
    operation as you conduct pilots and proof of concepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comply with
    regulations related to the transfer of financial assets and tokens
    with monetary value. Engaging with legal counsel can save potential
    headaches later on in your process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assume unknown
    unknowns. Incorporate flexibility into your project timelines to
    accommodate surprises along the way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
