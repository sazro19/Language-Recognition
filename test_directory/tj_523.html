<p dir="ltr">Worldwide smartphone shipments leveled off during the first quarter of 2016, marking the smallest year-over-year growth on record, according to preliminary data released today by <a href="http://www.idc.com/">International Data Corp. (IDC)</a>, a market research firm. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Vendors shipped a total of 334.9 million smartphones during Q1 2016, up slightly from the 334.3 million units shipped in Q1 2015. The minimal growth was caused by strong smartphone saturation in developed markets, as well as year-over-year declines from both <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> and <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/">Samsung</a>, the two market leaders. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The most significant change to the market was the addition of lesser-known Chinese brands <a href="http://www.oppodigital.com/">Oppo</a> and <a href="http://www.vivoglobal.com/">Vivo</a>, which pushed aside previous fourth- and fifth-place sellers Lenovo and Xiaomi, respectively. Nonetheless, as the Chinese market matures, the demand for smartphones has slowed dramatically. </p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2013, China’s year-over-year shipment growth was 62.5 percent. By 2015, it had dropped to 2.5 percent, IDC reported. In contrast, the average selling price for a smartphone in China rose from $207 (U.S.) in 2013 to $257 in 2015. </p>

<p dir="ltr">“Along China’s maturing smartphone adoption curve, the companies most aligned with growth are those with products serving increasingly sophisticated consumers,” said Melissa Chau, senior research manager with IDC’s <a href="http://www.idc.com/tracker/showproductinfo.jsp?prod_id=37">Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker</a>, in a prepared statement. “Now Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, which play mainly in the sub-$250 range, are positioned for a strong 2016. These new vendors would be well advised not to rest on their laurels though, as this dynamic smartphone landscape has shown to even cult brands like Xiaomi that customer loyalty is difficult to consistently maintain.” </p>
<p dir="ltr">Anthony Scarsella, research manager with IDC’s <a href="http://www.idc.com/analysts/viewteamprofile.jsp?containerId=TEA001052">Mobile Phone</a> team, said many brands are virtually unknown outside of China, yet they need to break into mature markets such as the United States and Western Europe if they want to compete with Apple or Samsung at the top of the global smartphone heap. </p>
