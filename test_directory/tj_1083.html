<p><a href="http://www.edline.net/pages/OurWayCS" target="_blank">Pemayetv Emahakv Our Way Charter School</a> in Florida has purchased nearly 200 refurbished MacBook Pros, iPads and iMacs at a cost 40 percent less than new products from Apple.</p>
<p>According to the school's IT director, Shelley Brantley, cost savings were the driving factor behind the decision to buy refurbished devices. "We knew we needed to upgrade our technology, but it just didn't make fiscal sense," she said in a prepared statement. The refurbished option did make financial sense. </p>
<p>Pemayetv Emahakv School purchased the Apple devices from <a href="http://www.mactoschool.com/" target="_blank">Mac to School</a>, a company that buys, sells and refurbishes Apple computers and equipment for public and private schools throughout the United States. According to information provided by the company, "the district could have paid more than $100,000 to buy new technology directly from Apple," but the school saved 40 percent by purchasing refurbished technology instead.</p>
<p>While Pemayetv Emahakv Charter School saved money buying technology, Mac to School offers another option to help schools stretch their IT budgets. The company also purchases Apple products from districts, putting money back in the coffers to use for technology upgrades. The company coordinates and pays for shipping to its site and provides districts with certificates of data destruction.</p>
