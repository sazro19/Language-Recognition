<p>Designing high-capacity and widely available networks is essential for meeting the
digital learning goals, according to a new <a href="https://www.setda.org/master/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Broadband-State-Leadership-2019_final.pdf">SETDA
study</a>.  The report looks into how individual states
are working to close the digital divide in education by creating
dedicated networks for schools and funding grant programs.</p>
<p>“In order to
provide personalized learning experiences for students to best
prepare them for college and careers, and to compete in a global
economy, all schools need access to reliable, high-speed broadband,”
said SETDA’s incoming executive director, Candice Dodson. “No two
states approach broadband implementation the same; however, state
leadership is essential to the process in implementing high-speed
broadband for all.”</p>
<p>Some examples in the
report include:</p>

<p>The <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/DAS/CTEdTech/Commission-for-Educational-Technology">Connecticut
	Commission for Educational Technology</a> oversees
	<a href="https://ctedunet.net/">Connecticut
	Education Network</a>, which is one of the first state
	networks in the country to connect every school district to fiber.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The <a href="http://nheon.org/nhsci/">New
	Hampshire School Connectivity Initiative</a> is a
	collaboration between state organizations and organizations involved
	with expanding connectivity and broadband services for all K-12
	schools and students in the state.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The <a href="http://www.doe.virginia.gov/">Virginia
	Department of Education</a> established the K-12 Learning
	Infrastructure Program in 2015 to bring fiber to schools that need
	it, ensure that classrooms have updated and reliable WiFi, help
	divisions secure more broadband funding for their budgets and assist
	schools with the E-rate process to get discounts for internet access
	and internal connections.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The New Jersey
	Digital Readiness for Learning Assessment Project is a collaboration
	between the <a href="https://www.escnj.us/">Educational
	Services Commission of New Jersey</a> and the <a href="https://www.state.nj.us/education/">NJ
	Department of Education</a> to expand internet access
	among K-12 schools through cooperative purchasing initiatives.</p>

When it comes to developing strategies for affordable internet access
for off-campus students, the report found 12 states have community
partnerships, 13 with connecting anchor institutions and five with
existing state funding.  Nine states have instituted WiFi on busses
and seven states have mandated legislative funding for off-campus
access.</p>
<p>In conjunction with
the release of the report, SETDA has published the State K-12
Education Broadband Map, which shows how each state is using
broadband through different models including the statewide networks,
regional networks and alternative strategies.  The map can be viewed
