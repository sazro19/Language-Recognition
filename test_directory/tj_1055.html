<p><a href="Microsoft" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> took the wraps off a plan Tuesday to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/education/ConnectED" target="_blank">discount Windows-based devices for United States schools</a>. The company, along with partners <a href="http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/26/k-12-solutions" target="_blank">Dell</a>, <a href="http://www.lenovo.com/education/us/en/k12/k12_administrators_teachers.html" target="_blank">Lenovo</a> and others, is launching an education program that will cut up to $1 billion in costs on software and devices in the coming year by opening up discounts that were previously available only to high-needs institutions.</p>
<p>According to Microsoft, the program "specifically supports President Obama's ConnectED goals of connecting U.S. schools to the digital age within five years by providing cost-efficient devices and services."</p>
<p>The program includes discounts on hardware (tablets, laptops and other devices) and access to software and training, including Microsoft's Partners in Learning teacher  resources. Microsoft will also give away IT Academy "for the roughly 2,000 at-risk designated schools" in the United States "to provide the schools and their educators, students and staff with the digital curriculum and certifications to gain fundamental technology skills and be successful in today's best jobs."</p>

<p>The company is also contributing $1 million "to cover certification exams for students from these schools."</p>
<p>"Education is the most important investment we can make for our collective future," said Judson Althoff, president of Microsoft North America, in a prepared statement. "With this new Microsoft education offer, we are heeding the President's challenge to ensure all students have access to the technology devices and services they need to succeed."</p>
<p>"Education transformation is happening now and technology is the tool that not only will enhance the work of our educators, but will allow a more immersive, engaging experience for our students," said Margo Day, vice president, U.S. Education, Microsoft. "For more than a decade, Microsoft has helped educators and school leaders connect, collaborate and create so that students can realize their greatest potential. With this new offer, we can extend that experience to all of our U.S. schools and students."</p>
<p>The program is being offered  through Microsoft partners serving K-12, which include Dell and Lenovo.</p>
<p>"At Dell, we are committed to providing students and teachers with comprehensive technology solutions that support their personalized learning environments and advance innovation in the classroom," said Bill Rodrigues, president, North America and global sales at Dell. "We share the goals of the education community and the president's ConnectED initiative and are proud to partner with Microsoft to maximize access to digital learning with affordable and efficient IT solutions."</p>
<p>"Lenovo's long-standing commitment to K–12 public education in the [United States] makes it an easy decision for us to join Microsoft as part of this initiative," said Jason Mooneyham, executive director, public sector, Lenovo. "If all of our kids are going to realize the promise of technology's contribution to their education, we have to do our part to work with their districts in choosing tools to help make access a reality."</p>
<p>The program is open immediately to all public schools in the United States. Complete details can be found at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/education/ConnectED" target="_blank">microsoft.com/education/ConnectED</a>.</p>
