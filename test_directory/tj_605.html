<p>The digital leap is at a tipping point. School districts nationwide are rapidly turning to digital learning content from sites and apps, according to the Consortium for School Networking's report <em>Identity and Access Management: Fundamentals for Securing Student Data and Privacy</em>. According to the report, this move is inspired by "the power of digital media to engage students in learning that is relevant to them in the classroom and beyond." In fact, CoSN's<em> 2015</em> <em>K–12 IT Leadership Survey</em> finds that district technology leaders expect that at least 50 percent of instructional materials will be digital within three years.</p>
<p>Unless districts better manage students' access to online resources, the digital leap could slow to a crawl. Robust identity and access-management technologies should go hand-in-hand with the shift to digital content. These emerging technologies can provide several benefits:</p>

<li><strong>Instructional value </strong>with safe, secure and efficient access to digital content;</li>
<li><strong>improved risk management</strong> with password security and heightened control of student data;</li>
<li><strong>automation and efficiency</strong> with consolidated user accounts and access routes to digital content; and</li>
<li><strong>transparency </strong>for parents who want to know how student information is used and shared. </li>
</ol>
<p>There are two areas of concern, however. The first challenge teachers and students face is managing and remembering logins and passwords for a large number of applications. The second issue is students' release of power to third-party software, enabling the software to take actions such as sending e-mails on students' behalf.</p>
<p><strong>Provisioning Access and Data Sharing</strong><br/>
Securing students' data and privacy is becoming more complicated, as districts contract with cloud service providers for access to digital content. Educators must carefully consider how they provide access rights to online content and share student data within and beyond the district. They must ask questions such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>What can users access online, and what are they allowed to do?</li>
<li>How will the digital resources be managed to provide required access?</li>
<li>What data about students is shared?</li>
<li>Who decides what is shared?</li>
<li>How is data sharing controlled?</li>
</ol>
<p>A third-grader could sign on to an LMS with a username and password, giving her access to grade-appropriate or classroom-specific digital learning resources. An English language learner might have access to a different set of resources to support learning. A 12th-grader signing on to the same LMS might be able to access more advanced content.  Meanwhile, a teacher would have greater access privileges to instructional and administrative resources, such as diagnostic tools, lesson plans and gradebooks.</p>

<h3><strong>The 5 'A's of Identity and Access Management</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong> is the process of identifying a user through a username or ID, password, smart card, fingerprint or other means.</li>
<li><strong>Authorization </strong>is the process of specifying access rights to online resources, generally by linking demographic data from a student information system (or, for staff, from a human resource system) into an identity management system.</li>
<li><strong>Account Management</strong> is creating user accounts and the provisioning and de-provisioning of access rights to online content.</li>
<li><strong>Authoritative</strong> refers to the validity and accuracy of data used to manage online accounts. For example, the SIS is considered the best, trusted "source of truth" about student identity when creating accounts, as opposed to a teacher's classroom roster or school secretary's spreadsheet, which might not be accurate or current.</li>
<li><strong>Auditing</strong> is digital recordkeeping of users' access to online resources, requiring reliable authentication of users' identity. Auditing technology supports periodic review of users' online activity to ensure adherence to data and privacy policies and to investigate any suspicious activity or breaches. Some districts conduct annual internal audits of their systems and practices to monitor who had access to what from where, and what powers they had. Others hire third-party auditors to conduct this review.  </li>
