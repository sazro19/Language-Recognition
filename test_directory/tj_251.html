<p><em>THE Journal</em> spoke with Furman about his visions for 21st century students and educators. </p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> What do you mean when you say we need a revolution in education? And why do you call your <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a> series “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGM9mHQi5sWg9BPj9PtZDbQ" target="_blank">The Seditionists</a>”? </strong><br/>
 <br/>
<strong>Robert Furman:</strong> We need to make the changes necessary for the 21st century. [In American history] the seditionists talked of revolution; they talked of the need for change in a grand way.</p>
<p>We talk like we’re revolutionaries. We definitely want to be heard, in terms of the importance, of the need for change in education. We need to make the changes necessary so we fit with our mainstream society, and we give kids the skills they need — digital age skills: the need for collaboration and leadership and all those things we talk about in terms of digital age skills.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things educators do by accident. We need to be aware of what we’re doing, and the fact that these kids need these skills. You could be teaching facts and memorization and things [by rote]. We may have AI machines doing half that stuff for you. Having those digital age skills are going to be eternal.</p>
<p>Only 10 years ago, there was no iPad, iPhone or Netflix. Just in 10 short years, look at how much has changed. We’re probably not going to have to learn how to drive.</p>
<p>To have these digital age skills — no matter what — [students are] going to be armed with these skills that are going to help them regardless. </p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> What should we be doing differently on a policy level? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Furman:</strong> It’s so unfortunate. From the federal government, down to the state government, the policymakers aren’t educators. We’re still doing high stakes accountability testing. </p>
<p>There are schools [and administrators] that are mocking us on the international stage. They’re laughing at us. We went back to accountability. [Schools from other countries] just proved that it doesn’t’ work.</p>
<p>Policymakers need to be educators — true educators, true believers in what we’re trying to do here.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE Journal:</em> Why go through so much change? Is it really necessary?</strong></p>
