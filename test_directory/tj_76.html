<p class="deck" id="ph_pcontent3_3_Deck">With the focus on providing better services to students and teachers, the applications for Internet of Things is projected to grow exponentially in the K-12 setting, but questions are becoming increasingly apparent on how to protect school data under controlled conditions.</p>

<p>The Internet of Things has the ability to transform how school districts work and operate in the modern area. Through applications such as connected school buses to remotely-controlled HVAC systems, the opportunities to provide robust connectivity options and more focused solutions for school management are attractive options for school district CIOs.</p>
<p>However, all of the possibilities must be considered with student safety as the top priority. Concerns about student privacy are also paramount and the ability to track students through RFID cards and monitor website traffic comes with its own set of challenges.</p>
<p>“People are surprisingly lax about their own security practices, but they are hypersensitive and concerned about giving data up around their children,” said Kelly Calhoun Williams, a research vice president at<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en"> Gartner</a>. “There are complexities in the application of IoT for K-12 that is different than what the typical consumer wants. The presence of IoT is going to continue to increase in school environments and they will overcome sensitivity over time.”</p>

<p>While districts have shown an interest in making their schools more connected through IoT applications, the first area of deployment for many is making school buses into hubs for doing homework and increasing safety visibility for bus drivers. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Mechanics behind connected school buses</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cosn.org/sites/default/files/CoSNs%202018%202019%20Annual%20Infrastructure%20Survey%20Report%20final_0.pdf">CoSN’s 2018-2019 Infrastructure Survey</a>, 35 percent of school districts do not provide support for students without broadband access at home. To fill that gap, many school districts are exploring options to outfit school buses with WiFi hotspots to allow students to complete their homework in route to school, field trips or sporting events.</p>
<p>Missouri’s <a href="https://www.raytownschools.org/">Raytown Quality Schools</a> has found success with implementing WiFi on school buses, but they realized that barriers needed to be placed on the type of information that could be accessed almost immediately. On the first day of the district’s pilot, Kevin Easley, Raytown’s department of transportation director, found students consumed all of the data that his team had budgeted for entire month.</p>
<p>“We chose to allow students access the app store on their phones on the first day that Apple released an iOS update,” Easley said. “After we figured out why we burned through so much data, we took steps to limit the use of the network to things that are only educational.”</p>
<p>Now, students are able to get a seamless experience between using cellular network hotspots on their school buses and getting immediate connectivity through wireless networks as they enter school grounds. School bus drivers can also get advantages through the use of connected technology solutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kajeet.net/">Kajeet</a> has developed a SmartBus solution that enables administrators to track buses through GPS, an RFID reader to track when students get on and off the bus and cameras to monitor student activity inside and outside the bus. Companies like <a href="https://cradlepoint.com/">Cradlepoint</a> provide the network routers and the connectivity with companies such Verizon and AT&amp;T to make the end-to-end connections.</p>
<p>With school districts gaining the ability to provide Chromebooks and tablets to students for school use, the need to provide connectivity outside the classroom becomes more paramount. <a href="https://www.greenville.k12.sc.us/">Greenville County Schools</a>, the largest school district in South Carolina, recognized that need and deployed WiFi hotspots to its entire 425 bus fleet to give students an additional 28,000 hours of instructional time. </p>
