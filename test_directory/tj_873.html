<p>A school’s technology staff is always on the go, so they need a mobile ecosystem that is as flexible as they are. Following up on last month’s <a href="http://thejournal.realviewdigital.com/?iid=97359#folio=20">article</a> in which we asked principals for their mission-critical apps, we sought out mobile-savvy technology directors and coordinators and asked them to share the applications and mobile-friendly Web tools that they use to work with teachers, manage technology and schedule their days the smart way. Here’s what they had to say. </p>
<p><strong>1) </strong><a href="file://localhost/url"><strong>Evernote</strong></a><strong> </strong><br/>
Susan Bearden, who has worked in various technology roles throughout her career and is now the director of IT at <a href="http://www.htacademy.org"><strong>Holy Trinity Episcopal Academy</strong></a> (FL), said, “I use Evernote because I can access my content wherever I am.” To Bearden, that compatibility is important, as she’s liable to switch among four different computing devices on any given day. “I can create notes on the fly and you can add other content, like audio or pictures,” she added. Bearden frequently uses the app to take notes in meetings, document the state of her school’s technology and share files with others via Dropbox. It also serves as her daily to-do list via a built-in “checkbox” feature. </p>

<p><strong>2) </strong><a href="file://localhost/us/app/notability/id360593530"><strong>Notability</strong></a><br/>
Allen Miedema, the director of technology for <a href="http://wwwnew.nsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1"><strong>Northshore School District</strong></a> in Bothell, WA, relies on this note-taking mainstay, which he originally picked because it scored top marks in syncing up with the file-sharing sites he uses. “I also like that Notability gives me a couple different ways that I can take notes,” he said. “If I want to type some notes, which I normally do, I can, but if I want to do some drawing and put in some audio I can do that as well, without it getting too complicated.” </p>
<p>3) <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fhapara.com%2F&amp;ei=-4_QU5vlF9H_oQTo14HYCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFqQoh7d4fNbEC4G_wN_iREocIh6w&amp;sig2=Rs0ThSbxBFLP9hycg4Fw9w&amp;bvm=bv.71667212,d.cGU"><strong>Hapara</strong></a> <br/>
This tool works with desktops as well as mobile devices. Miedema’s district has come to rely on Hapara, whose name was taken from the Maori word for “daybreak.” The program acts as a layer over Google Apps for Education, letting users organize their documents by subject and move them around. Students, for example, can complete work, alert their teacher and drop it in special “completed” or “homework” folders. Teachers can check on students’ progress from an iPad through a “remote control” feature and can even control student devices if they wish. “Our classroom teachers use it all day long, whether they know they’re using it or not,” said Miedema. </p>
<p>Hapara also links up with other district systems to automatically enroll and drop students as they come and go. In a district like Northshore, which has a high mobility rate, this feature creates significant time savings. “Say you’re a secondary math teacher and you have 150 kids,” Miedema said. “You can create those folders, but managing those folders as kids come and go can be a huge problem. Hapara ties into our Active Directory services and our student information system. As a kid enrolls in your geometry class, it creates a folder in the right place, so the new kid has a Google Apps space before they walk into your classroom, and it all happens automatically. I know if we took it away from our secondary teachers they’d stop using Google Docs. Their class lists would just become unmanageable.” </p>
