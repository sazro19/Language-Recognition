<p><a href="http://www.filetransporter.com/" target="_blank">Connected Data</a> has introduced
its Transporter Network Storage Connector, which is designed to provide secure
remote access to data stored in on-premise network attached storage (NAS)
systems, without the need for a virtual private network (VPN) connection.</p>
<p>The connector synchronizes data stored on NAS systems with shared folders on
a Transporter 75 or 150 private cloud appliance, so authorized users can access
the data over the Internet from anywhere. According to the company, "terabytes
of files can be easily accessed over the Internet while the data remains 100
percent private and is stored only on site for assured regulatory compliance,
privacy, security and control."</p>
<p>"IT wants control over company data, but user needs have evolved and VPNs
are considered difficult and unreliable, increasing user pressure to deliver
cloud-like file sharing flexibility without the VPN," said Geoff Barrall, CEO
of Connected Data, in a prepared statement. The company claims that its
Transporter appliances featuring the new Network Storage Connector can tackle
this challenge.</p>
