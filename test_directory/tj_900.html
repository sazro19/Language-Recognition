<p>The typical K-12 school district supports three computing  platforms for instruction and at least two platforms for administration  functions. Those may include Windows, Google Chrome, Google Android and Apple operating  systems.</p>
<p>In fact, flavors of all four platforms are in use for  instructional purposes at 28 percent of districts and for administrative uses  at 22 percent of districts. Three platforms — Windows, Apple and Android — are  the primary picks for instruction at 27 percent of districts and at 17 percent  of districts for the administrative work. Windows and Apple together dominate  for instruction in 28 percent of districts and for administrative activities at  27 percent of districts. A single operating system — Windows — rules in  instruction at 17 percent of districts and in administration at 34 percent of  districts.</p>
<p>That's what <a href="https://www.cdwg.com/" target="_blank">CDW-G</a> found  when it surveyed 175 IT professionals within public school districts. (That  sample size has a margin of error of plus or minus 7.42 percent at a 95 percent  confidence level.)</p>

<p>Windows still dominates overall for instruction, with 83  percent of districts turning to Microsoft's operating system. A slightly higher  number — 86 percent — choose it for administration purposes. </p>
<p>In a multi-platform environment, 46 percent of IT  professionals report being challenged in finding the in-house expertise to  support all of them. Forty-five percent cite improving or upgrading  infrastructure and 44 percent list professional development for instruction as  challenges.</p>
<p>Those surveyed also offered advice to their peers regarding  the support of multiple operating systems. Advised one respondent:  "Consider all stakeholders. In K-12, it's all about the curriculum. If the  teachers and students won't use it, then it is fruitless." Suggested  another, "Do your homework and check for app conflicts across Windows and  Android." And a third simply said, "Use a slow, targeted  rollout."</p>
