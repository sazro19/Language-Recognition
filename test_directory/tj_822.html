<p><a href="http://www.renaissance.com/">Renaissance Learning</a> has unveiled <a href="http://www.renaissance.com/products/accelerated-reader">Accelerated  Reader 360</a> (AR 360), an updated version of Accelerated Reader that adds new  resources and activities for students.</p>
<p>New resources available through  AR 360 include digital informational texts and activities for instructional  skills practice.</p>
<p>"Through  AR 360's integrated reading program, students continue their independent  reading practice, while teachers now have tools to help students engage with  more nonfiction texts, read more complex texts with instructional support and  build skills around evidence-based reading responses," according to a news  release.</p>
<p>The  leveled nonfiction articles are searchable by topic and skill to assist with  standards alignment and close reading. Each one "includes built-in  instructional skills practice" such as highlighting and tag  activities and writing prompts.<br/>
The  platform also includes a <a href="http://www.renaissance.com/products/dashboard">reading  dashboard</a> designed to provide actionable insights into student performance,  streamlining the multiple reports used by the previous version.</p>

<p>"We've seen a lot of changes happening in  the classroom over the past couple of years, with the rapid adoption of  technology and more rigorous standards challenging our teachers to push student  achievement even higher — but one thing that has not changed is that teachers  are still at the core of maximizing student success," said Jack Lynch, CEO  of Renaissance Learning, in a prepared statement. "Now, with AR 360 we're  providing educators with the tools to confidently address key shifts, and  students will move comfortably into more complex texts and learn to  strategically use technology to learn and achieve."</p>
