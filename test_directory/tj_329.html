<p>Three “change agents” who have upended the status quo in their own unique ways will be the keynote speakers at the <a href="http://www.iste.org" target="_blank">International Society for Technology in Education</a>’s (ISTE) <a href="http://conference.iste.org/2017/" target="_blank">conference and expo in San Antonio, TX</a>, June 25-28.</p>
<p>ISTE’s aim is to advance the most important and influential trends in education technology, and ISTE 2017 will continue this tradition by offering more than 1,000 sessions and learning opportunities in a variety of formats to accommodate many different learning styles.</p>
<p>“This year’s keynote speakers each took unconventional paths in their careers, and their brave risk-taking allowed them to blaze new trails for their industries,” said ISTE Interim CEO Cheryl Scott Williams in a statement. “Their willingness to risk failure in order to drive transformation will resonate with the ISTE 2017 audience.”</p>
<p>Through their presentations and personal stories, the keynote speakers will highlight how looking at things in a new way, even if met with skepticism initially, can eventually open new doors of opportunity for learning and understanding.</p>

<p><strong>Jad Abumrad</strong>, host and creator of public radio’s “<a href="http://www.radiolab.org/" target="_blank">Radiolab</a>.” Abumrad employs his dual backgrounds as a composer and journalist to create what’s been called “a new aesthetic” in broadcast journalism. He orchestrates dialogue, music, interviews and sound effects into compelling documentaries that draw listeners into investigations of otherwise intimidating topics, including the nature of numbers, the evolution of altruism or the legal foundation for the war on terror.</p>
<p>“Radiolab’s” origin dates back to 2002 when Abumrad began tinkering with an idea for a new program that would be an open-ended radio laboratory. “Radiolab” emerged as the product of that tinkering and has evolved into one of public radio’s most popular programs, broadcast on 524 stations across the United States and downloaded more than 9 million times per month as a podcast.</p>
<p>Abumrad will be the opening keynote speaker Sunday, June 25, from 5:45-7 p.m.</p>

<p><strong>Jennie Magiera</strong> is chief innovation officer at <a href="http://www.d62.org" target="_blank">Des Plaines Public Schools</a> in Chicago and the author of “<a href="https://us.corwin.com/en-us/nam/courageous-edventures/book247884" target="_blank">Courageous Edventures</a>.” Previously the digital learning coordinator for the <a href="http://auslchicago.org" target="_blank">Academy for Urban School Leadership</a> and a teacher in <a href="http://cps.edu/" target="_blank">Chicago Public Schools</a>, Magiera believes that despite the many challenges facing schools today, every classroom can be a place for what she calls “edventures.”</p>
<p>Magiera is also devoted to reimagining professional development to ensure teachers receive relevant training and support. She has served on the Technical Working Group for the <a href="https://www.ed.gov" target="_blank">Department of Education</a>’s <a href="https://tech.ed.gov/netp/" target="_blank">National Educational Technology Plan</a> and co-founded various new conference concepts, including <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/playdatechicago13/home" target="_blank">Playdate</a>, a collaborative online space where educators tinker with ed tech tools, programs and apps.</p>
<p>Magiera shares her experiences with taking risks in the classroom and provides hints to help others feel comfortable doing so in her book, “Courageous Edventures.”</p>
