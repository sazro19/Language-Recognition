<p><a href="https://www.follettlearning.com/" target="_blank">Follett</a>, a provider of education technology, services and content, this week is rolling out a new tool, <a href="https://www.follettlearning.com/technology/products/library-management-system/collections-by-destiny" target="_blank">Collections by Destiny</a>, which will allow librarians, teachers and curriculum staff to share free or purchased resources across a district, schools or between users.</p>
<p>Collections “will provide educators around-the-clock access to quickly find the resources that provide more learning opportunities and practice content for fast delivery into the classroom,” according to a news release.</p>
<p>Follett provided a sneak preview of Collections during last week’s <a href="https://conference.iste.org/2017/" target="_blank">ISTE conference</a> in San Antonio, TX, and early reviews were “overwhelmingly positive,” according to Nader Qaimari, president of Follett School Solutions.</p>

<p>Collections is designed to include any resource, including open educational resources (OERs), web pages, images and documents, and these resources can be easily added with the click of a button, the release said. In a statement, Qaimari said “offering Collections is the first step toward making [Follett] Destiny a content discovery and resource collection tool designed for use in the classroom, the library and at home.” </p>
<p>“The device-agnostic and efficient mobile interface makes collecting resources easy — eliminating wasted time with lengthy searches — whether one is in the library, classroom, living room or virtually anywhere,” the release said.</p>
<p>A webinar providing an overview of Collections is scheduled for 3 p.m. EDT (noon PDT) Thursday, July 27. To register, visit <a href="http://bit.ly/2u3CruA" target="_blank">this site</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="http://bit.ly/2rIU19x" target="_blank">this video</a> helps illustrate how Collections is used.</p>
