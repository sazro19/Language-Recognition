<p>The <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT Media Lab</a>, <a href="http://www.tufts.edu/" target="_blank">Tufts University</a> and <a href="http://pbskids.org/" target="_blank">PBS Kids</a> have teamed up to release a free app  based on the <a href="http://www.scratchjr.org/" target="_blank">ScratchJr</a> coding language  and designed to help kids aged five to eight learn coding concepts.</p>
<p>"With the PBS KIDS ScratchJr app, kids can snap  together colorful programming blocks to make their favorite characters move,  jump, dance and sing," according to a news release from MIT. "In the  process, they learn to solve problems, design projects and express themselves  creatively. The free app is now available from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pbs-kids-scratchjr/id1047840202?at=10lwtJ+K-PBSK-Scratch-PRess" target="_blank">App  Store on iPad</a> and from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.pbskids.scratchjr" target="_blank">Google  Play store on Android tablet</a>."</p>
<p>To support the app, the <a href="http://www.verizon.com/about/responsibility/" target="_blank">Verizon Foundation</a>, the <a href="http://pbskids.org/readytolearn/" target="_blank">Ready To Learn Initiative</a> and  PBS stations will work with Title I schools. Verizon will also develop  afterschool programs and a weeklong summer camp, while PBS stations will  provide professional development designed to help teachers integrate the app  with their classrooms. </p>

<p>"To help ScratchJr learners get more out of the  programming language, Media Lab alumna Professor Marina Umaschi Bers, director  of the <a href="https://ase.tufts.edu/DevTech/" target="_blank">Developmental Technologies  Research Group</a> at Tufts University," and Mitchel Resnick, Lego Papert  professor of learning research at MIT, "have co-authored <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Official-ScratchJr-Book-Learn/dp/1593276710" target="_blank">'The  Official ScratchJr Book: Help Your Kids Learn to Code</a>,' released in  November," according to information released by MIT.</p>
<p>"We see coding as a new way for people to organize,  express and share their ideas," said Resnick, who is also head of the  Media Lab's <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/research/groups/lifelong-kindergarten" target="_blank">Lifelong  Kindergarten</a> group and director of its Scratch team, in a prepared  statement. "Coding is not just a set of technical skills, but a new type  of literacy and personal expression, valuable for everyone, much like learning  to write."</p>
