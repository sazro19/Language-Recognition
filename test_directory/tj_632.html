<p>The <a href="http://www.doe.nv.gov/" target="_blank">Nevada Department of Education</a> has
selected a data collection system for statewide use.</p>
<p>Until now, districts in the state used a variety of different data
collection systems, which meant sharing data between the districts and the
state required extra time and effort. After evaluating the available options,
the department selected the <a href="https://www.infinitecampus.com/products/state-edition" target="_blank">Infinite Campus
State Edition</a> (ICSE). According to a press release from the company,
"Infinite Campus already manages more than 94 percent of Nevada's student
data." The department also chose ICSE because of its off-the-shelf statewide
data management capabilities.</p>
<p>By selecting a statewide data management system, the Nevada Department of
Education and its K-12 school districts will be able to maintain a single
system, capture student data in real time and ensure secure bidirectional data
flow between the state and the districts. "ICSE will greatly improve
efficiencies and lower overall costs for the NDE and Nevada districts," said
Ashton Faires, regional director of sales for Infinite Campus, in a prepared
statement.</p>

<p>The Department of Education is working with Infinite Campus to roll out ICSE
and expects the system to be fully operational by July 2016. "There is a
lot of work that lies ahead, but we feel confident the final outcome will be an
improved experience for our local districts and NDE," said Steve Canavero,
deputy superintendent of student achievement at the Nevada Department of
Education, in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>Other states that have implemented Infinite Campus State Edition include
South Dakota, Montana, Kentucky, Maine, Hawaii and the Bureau of Indian
Education.</p>
