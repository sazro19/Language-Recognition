<p><a href="http://bedford.sharpschool.net/cms/One.aspx?portalId=1057261&amp;pageId=1057269" target="_blank">Bedford  County Public Schools</a>, with approximately 10,300 students, has adopted a  new tool in an effort to more uniformly capture and manage student data across  district schools.</p>
<p>The district was distributing and then collecting 15-20  forms to each student. The large volume of paperwork generated by enrollment  and registration kept administrators working through December just to update  the student information system (SIS) with the new data.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.pearsonschoolsystems.com/" target="_blank">Pearson</a> <a href="http://www.pearsonschoolsystems.com/products/powerschool/" target="_blank">PowerSchool</a> SIS user, the district decided to adopt <a href="https://www.infosnap.com/splash/" target="_blank">InfoSnap</a>, one of Pearson's  independent software vendors, to help streamline its student enrollment and  registration processes.</p>
<p>"Factoring in the cost of labor resources, paper and  ink, our InfoSnap solution saves us an average of $82,000 per year," said  Kevin Harrison, data manager at Bedford, in a prepared statement. "If  you analyze the time that staff would previously spend on printing 154,000-plus  sheets of paper, following up with families and manually processing and  polishing student data, it came at a significant cost to our school district."</p>

<p>The district also used the PowerSchool API to eliminate the need for  administrators to sign into InfoSnap, approve a student record, create a  download file and upload it to PowerSchool, combining the whole process into a  single step. Bedford also used the API to create custom fields in PowerSchool,  such as photo release forms and student medical conditions.</p>
<p>"The simplicity of the API is incredible — it's as  simple as pushing a button. What also impresses me is that I have the ability  to create an unlimited number of new fields and implement them as part of my  InfoSnap solution," added Harrison. "We place a call to our solution  specialist and it's done within minutes, so that our school staff can track  additional data."</p>
<p>"Working with the InfoSnap team to implement the  PowerSchool API was a huge success and the smoothest roll-out I've ever had for  an API," said Harrison. "Everything from start to finish was effortless,  because InfoSnap took care of us."</p>
