<p><a href="http://www.sheltonpublicschools.org/" target="_blank">Shelton Public Schools</a> in Connecticut has implemented Google Chromebox computers and 600
Chromebooks so staff and students can access Google Apps for Education
and Windows-based applications through a virtual desktop interface.</p>
<p>The district uses <a href="https://www.citrix.com/products/xenapp/overview.html" target="_blank">Citrix XenApp</a> technology to provide staff and students with access to district
computing resources from desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones
whether they are at home or at school. Users can log onto Citrix XenApp
from any device and then access the district's Windows applications in
a virtual desktop environment. </p>
<p>By using virtual desktop
infrastructure, Shelton Public Schools has saved "two million dollars
in technology costs over the past 10 years, and will continue to save
$120,000 a year in capital investments," according to a news release
from Citrix. The district collaborated with <a href="https://www.gothamtg.com/" target="_blank">Gotham Technology Group</a> to upgrade the district's computer equipment. Rather than purchasing
$500 desktop computers for classrooms, they purchased Google Chromebox
computers that mount on the back of a monitor and cost less than $200
each. And rather than purchasing $1,000 laptops, they purchased 600
Chromebooks, which cost approximately $200 each. The district also
continues to use older desktop computers to access the latest Windows
applications through Citrix XenApp.</p>

<p>"Although we can't replace
equipment as quickly as we want to, we can use Citrix to help lengthen
the lifespan of the equipment, simply by really using the older devices
as a vehicle with Citrix to provide the latest Windows-based desktop
for them," said Daniel DiVito, director of technology for Shelton
Public Schools, in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>Students can now use
computers or mobile devices to access online learning resources from
home or school, and teachers plan lessons, mark assignments and tests
and collaborate with colleagues from home in the evenings and on
weekends, rather than putting in long hours at school.</p>
