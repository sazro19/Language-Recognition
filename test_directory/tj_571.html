<p class="deck" id="ph_pcontent3_3_Deck">The numbers are in for our first annual K-12 IT salary survey. While budgeting frustrations hamper much of IT's work, there's also a sense that the work they're undertaking is important.</p>

<p>$63,776. That's the average annual pay for an IT professional of any rank, type of school or district or years of experience in this salary survey. Whether that sounds low to you or high, keep reading. As we've learned from hundreds of K-12 IT people who have shared details of their jobs, there's more to your work than a single number.</p>
<p>Because this is the first year that THE Journal has developed a salary survey, we lack a baseline against which to compare this year's numbers. (That will come next year.) So we hope you'll weigh in to let us know how close to the mark we came for your own salary and the other job measurements covered in this report.</p>
<p><strong>Average Salaries</strong><br/>
The average weighted IT salary in K-12 didn't vary much between public and private schools. At $63,824, public schools won by a nose against private schools at $63,634. The median (that point that falls exactly between the highest and lowest salaries) was $60,000 for both types of schools.</p>

<p>The smallest salaries were given out to people who work on a help desk or provide computer support. Their average weighted gross earnings were $41,425. On the opposite end of that spectrum were C-level people, the CIO, CTO, CSO or related titles. The average weighted salary for that group of individuals was $99,045. In between those two extremes, the three groups with the highest overall average earnings were:</p>
<p>1. Database and business intelligence staff: $76,436<br/>
2. Project management: $74,940<br/>
3. IT management: $72,993.50</p>

</div>
<p>Wide variations showed up in average salaries based not just on job title but also type of school — public versus private. For example, the highest compensated title in our survey was CIO. The average weighted salary for a CIO at a private school came in at $125,000. It was $98,889 in public school systems, a 21 percent difference. Likewise, a project manager in a public district earned a weighted average salary of $81,136; the same role in a private school earned $56,900 — 30 percent less.</p>

<p>The highest salary reported in our survey was $190,000, earned by an IT director at a public district in Indiana. The lowest salary came in at $15,000, recounted by a computer lab manager in New York and a help desk person in Kentucky, both at elementary schools.</p>
<p>To put those incomes into perspective, the average salary for a network administrator within any industry — not just education — was $79,770, <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm" target="_blank">according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting for May 2014</a>. If that sounds high to you, keep in mind that the average annual wage for elementary and middle school teachers (arguably the most vital people in any school) in that same reporting period was $57,080. A secondary school teacher earned $59,180 on average. Both of those are less than the reported average in our survey.</p>
<p><strong>Experience and Job Duration</strong><br/>
Most respondents (53 percent) have worked in IT for more than 11 years in both public and private schools. A third of people have been on the job between 11 and 20 years. One in 10 has been in IT for two years or less.</p>
