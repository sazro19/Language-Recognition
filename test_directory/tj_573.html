<p><a href="http://www.schoolmessenger.com/" target="_blank">SchoolMessenger</a>,  a school community engagement platform, has added an enhanced catalog feature  to its single sign-on product, <a href="http://www.schoolmessenger.com/k12-single-sign-on-solutions/" target="_blank">Passport</a>.</p>
<p>Passport lets teachers, students, staff and parents log into  multiple district-approved online learning applications, open educational  resources and school software programs with one user ID and password. Both the  standard and premium versions of Passport now include an enhanced catalog of  product connectors that enable single sign-on to Web-based services.</p>
<p>Along with Passport's enhanced catalog feature, the company  has introduced its new <a href="http://www.schoolmessenger.com/partners" target="_blank">SchoolMessenger  Ecosystem Program</a> for education technology providers, which lets companies  highlight their additional services, such as allowing schools to use one-click  account provisioning tools in the Passport catalog.</p>
<p>"Schools are often overwhelmed by the process of  selecting and deploying Web-based education products and securely sharing  approved data with their service providers," said Robert Iskander, general  manager of SchoolMessenger, in a prepared statement. </p>

<p>Districts will receive the enhanced catalog feature of  SchoolMessenger Passport as part of their regular product updates at no  additional cost and with no action required by districts.</p>
