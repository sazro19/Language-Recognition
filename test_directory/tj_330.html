<p><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com" target="_blank">SparkFun Electronics</a> has begun carrying the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14208" target="_blank">micro:bit</a> in the United States, starting this month and shipping in early May 2017. The micro:bit — a beginner-friendly, reprogrammable microcontroller — gained popularity after the <a href="http://www.bbc.com" target="_blank">BBC</a> gave the board to every 11- and 12-year-old student in the United Kingdom to inspire a new generation to pursue innovation in computer science.</p>
<p>The micro:bit, as an open development board, works in sync with other hardware components and soft materials to create projects that can ignite creativity using technology as an artistic medium, according to a news release. The micro:bit’s 25 LED array, Bluetooth and USB connectivity, embedded compass and accelerometer, as well as mobile and web-based programming capabilities, make the board an effective tool for teaching and engaging in computational thinking and basic electronics in an inspiring and interactive way, the release said.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://www.google.com/chromebook/" target="_blank">Google Chromebook</a>-compatible board, the micro:bit can be integrated into a classroom’s existing technological framework. The micro:bit can be programmed using a number of platforms such as <a href="https://makecode.com" target="_blank">MakeCode</a>, an online environment where the user can choose either block or text-based (JavaScript) programming; <a href="https://micropython.org" target="_blank">MicroPython</a>; as well as many others that give users the opportunity to learn a variety of programming languages and their connection to hardware. The board is also compatible with Android and iOS code editors for mobile programming.</p>
<p>“We’re always looking for opportunities to support teachers’ efforts in finding new ways for students to explore programming and hardware,” said SparkFun CEO Glenn Samala in a statement. “Given the micro:bit’s wild success as a teaching tool overseas, we look forward to sharing it with our friends in education here in the United States.”</p>
<p>SparkFun is launching a contest Wednesday, giving away 30 micro:bits to teachers so they can start sourcing their ideas on all the ways a micro:bit can be used.</p>
<p>For more information on the micro:bit , to pre-order or to enter the contest, visit <a href="http://sparkfuneducation.com" target="_blank">sparkfuneducation.com</a>.</p>
