<p>Students and teachers at several of our schools noticed something amazing and new at the beginning of this school year when they logged on to their computers: For the first time, students and staff were able to gain access to all of their software applications and information 24/7 — anywhere, anytime, through practically any device.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.buffaloschools.org/" target="_blank">Buffalo Public Schools</a> (BPS) is making a significant investment in virtualization technology to ensure our students and staff can leverage technology in their learning experience for maximum benefit, now and in the future. Built upon <a href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_blank">VMware's</a> Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), this innovation is delivering dramatic advantages to the BPS computing landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Providing Access</strong><br/>
Students 	and faculty can now gain secure access to their files and programs 	anywhere, anytime, from most devices (smart phones, tablets, laptops 	and home computers). </p>
<p>With secure remote access through VDI, a user's 	applications and documents will always be available, just as they 	left them at the end of the school day. This dramatic improvement in 	accessibility opens up endless possibilities for collaboration and 	inspiration. With log-in times on a virtual desktop reduced to 30 	seconds, there's more room for instructional time, and faster 	access to applications and information.</p>

<p><strong>Delivering Common Core Assessments</strong><br/>
The 	Buffalo City School District can now more effectively support the 	upcoming Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and 	Careers (PARCC) assessments that are being mandated for K-12 	students. </p>
<p>New York is a governing state in the PARCC Consortium, a 	20-state consortium working together to develop next-generation K-12 	assessments in English and Math. As such, the state is participating 	in the field testing of the PARCC assessments in the upcoming 	2013-2014 school year. As the second largest school district in New 	York, the Buffalo District is committed to ensuring that this 	program has every chance at success in our community to support our 	children's future educational opportunities. Leveraging our 	investment in virtualization technology will help us to provide a 	PARCC-compliant standardized testing delivery vehicle, both 	effectively and painlessly. </p>
<p><strong>Controlling Costs</strong><br/>
The 	overall changes we are implementing, including the replacement of 	traditional desktops with thin clients, will help us to reduce 	operating costs such as electricity and capital costs such as 	computer hardware.</p>
<p>Virtualization technology significantly reduces 	the electricity needed to power our computer systems, and it also 	helps us to extend the life of our technology investments and escape 	the relentless three- to five-year "tech refresh" cycle that is so 	expensive. In addition, we anticipate long-term savings as we 	leverage this investment to share resources and partner with nearby 	school districts. </p>
<p><strong>Addressing Changing Needs</strong><br/>
As 	instructional needs change, VDI provides IT with 	more agility to almost immediately push out instructional resources 	such as online resources, instructional  links and software 	updates. This enables IT to be tremendously more helpful in meeting 	the changing needs of students and teachers by providing a more 	dynamic classroom and a better use of resources the school system 	has already invested in. Ultimately, VDI can make learning materials 	more readily available to faculty and students.</p>
<p>With three years of research, planning and preparation under our belts, our technology journey now begins in earnest. We've built two new data centers to support our implementation of VDI, and we've rolled it out to fifteen schools in January 2014. We are excited to improve our agility and responsiveness, and in order to ensure that we are providing the best possible learning environment for our community, we look forward to hearing from our students and faculty regarding how this technology impacts their learning and teaching experience. </p>
